joyce
i
stately
plump
buck
mulligan
came
from
the
stairhead
bearing
a
bowl
of
lather
on
which
a
mirror
and
a
razor
lay
crossed
a
yellow
dressinggown
ungirdled
was
sustained
gently
behind
him
on
the
mild
morning
air
he
held
the
bowl
aloft
and
intoned
ad
altare
dei
halted
he
peered
down
the
dark
winding
stairs
and
called
out
coarsely
up
kinch
come
up
you
fearful
jesuit
solemnly
he
came
forward
and
mounted
the
round
gunrest
he
faced
about
and
blessed
gravely
thrice
the
tower
the
surrounding
land
and
the
awaking
mountains
then
catching
sight
of
stephen
dedalus
he
bent
towards
him
and
made
rapid
crosses
in
the
air
gurgling
in
his
throat
and
shaking
his
head
stephen
dedalus
displeased
and
sleepy
leaned
his
arms
on
the
top
of
the
staircase
and
looked
coldly
at
the
shaking
gurgling
face
that
blessed
him
equine
in
its
length
and
at
the
light
untonsured
hair
grained
and
hued
like
pale
oak
buck
mulligan
peeped
an
instant
under
the
mirror
and
then
covered
the
bowl
smartly
to
barracks
he
said
sternly
he
added
in
a
preacher
s
tone
this
o
dearly
beloved
is
the
genuine
christine
body
and
soul
and
blood
and
ouns
slow
music
please
shut
your
eyes
gents
one
moment
a
little
trouble
about
those
white
corpuscles
silence
all
he
peered
sideways
up
and
gave
a
long
slow
whistle
of
call
then
paused
awhile
in
rapt
attention
his
even
white
teeth
glistening
here
and
there
with
gold
points
chrysostomos
two
strong
shrill
whistles
answered
through
the
calm
old
chap
he
cried
briskly
that
will
do
nicely
switch
off
the
current
will
you
he
skipped
off
the
gunrest
and
looked
gravely
at
his
watcher
gathering
about
his
legs
the
loose
folds
of
his
gown
the
plump
shadowed
face
and
sullen
oval
jowl
recalled
a
prelate
patron
of
arts
in
the
middle
ages
a
pleasant
smile
broke
quietly
over
his
lips
mockery
of
it
he
said
gaily
your
absurd
name
an
ancient
greek
he
pointed
his
finger
in
friendly
jest
and
went
over
to
the
parapet
laughing
to
himself
stephen
dedalus
stepped
up
followed
him
wearily
halfway
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
gunrest
watching
him
still
as
he
propped
his
mirror
on
the
parapet
dipped
the
brush
in
the
bowl
and
lathered
cheeks
and
neck
buck
mulligan
s
gay
voice
went
on

is
absurd
too

himself

go
to
athens
will

if
i
can
get
the
aunt
to
fork
out
twenty
quid
he
laid
the
brush
aside
and
laughing
with
delight
cried
he
come
the
jejune
jesuit
ceasing
he
began
to
shave
with
care
me
mulligan
stephen
said
quietly

love

to
stay
in
this
tower
buck
mulligan
showed
a
shaven
cheek
over
his
right
shoulder
isn
t
he
dreadful
he
said
frankly
a
ponderous
saxon
he
thinks
you
re
not
a
gentleman
god
these
bloody
english
bursting
with
money
and
indigestion
because
he
comes
from

you
have
the
real
oxford
manner
he
can
t
make
you
out
o
my
name
for
you
is
the
best
kinch
the
he
shaved
warily
over
his
chin
was
raving
all
night
about
a
black
panther
stephen
said
where
is
his
guncase
woful
lunatic
mulligan
said
were
you
in
a
funk
was
stephen
said
with
energy
and
growing
fear
out
here
in
the
dark
with
a
man
i
don
t
know
raving
and
moaning
to
himself
about
shooting
a
black
panther
you
saved
men
from
drowning
i
m
not
a
hero
however
if
he
stays
on
here
i
am
off
buck
mulligan
frowned
at
the
lather
on
his
razorblade
he
hopped
down
from
his
perch
and
began
to
search
his
trouser
pockets
hastily
he
cried
thickly
he
came
over
to
the
gunrest
and
thrusting
a
hand
into
stephen
s
upper
pocket
said
us
a
loan
of
your
noserag
to
wipe
my
razor
stephen
suffered
him
to
pull
out
and
hold
up
on
show
by
its
corner
a
dirty
crumpled
handkerchief
buck
mulligan
wiped
the
razorblade
neatly
then
gazing
over
the
handkerchief
he
said
bard

noserag

new
art
colour

our
irish
poets
snotgreen
you
can
almost
taste
it

t
you
he
mounted
to
the
parapet
again
and
gazed
out
over
dublin
bay
his
fair
oakpale
hair
stirring
slightly
he
said
quietly
isn
t
the
sea
what
algy
calls

great
sweet

come
and

stephen
stood
up
and
went
over
to
the
parapet
leaning
on
it
he
looked
down
on
the
water
and
on
the
mailboat
clearing
the
harbourmouth
of
kingstown
mighty
mother
buck
mulligan
said
he
turned
abruptly
his
grey
searching
eyes
from
the
sea
to
stephen
s
face
aunt
thinks
you
killed
your
mother
he
said
that
s
why
she
won
t
let
me
have
anything
to
do
with
you
killed
her
stephen
said
gloomily
could
have
knelt
down
damn
it
kinch
when
your
dying
mother
asked
you
buck
mulligan
said
i
m
hyperborean
as
much
as
you
but
to
think
of
your
mother
begging
you
with
her
last
breath
to
kneel
down
and
pray
for
her
and
you
refused
there
is
something
sinister
in
you
he
broke
off
and
lathered
again
lightly
his
farther
cheek
a
tolerant
smile
curled
his
lips
a
lovely
mummer
he
murmured
to
himself
kinch
the
loveliest
mummer
of
them
all
he
shaved
evenly
and
with
care
in
silence
seriously
stephen
an
elbow
rested
on
the
jagged
granite
leaned
his
palm
against
his
brow
and
gazed
at
the
fraying
edge
of
his
shiny
black
pain
that
was
not
yet
the
pain
of
love
fretted
his
heart
silently
in
a
dream
she
had
come
to
him
after
her
death
her
wasted
body
within
its
loose
brown
graveclothes
giving
off
an
odour
of
wax
and
rosewood
her
breath
that
had
bent
upon
him
mute
reproachful
a
faint
odour
of
wetted
ashes
across
the
threadbare
cuffedge
he
saw
the
sea
hailed
as
a
great
sweet
mother
by
the
wellfed
voice
beside
him
the
ring
of
bay
and
skyline
held
a
dull
green
mass
of
liquid
a
bowl
of
white
china
had
stood
beside
her
deathbed
holding
the
green
sluggish
bile
which
she
had
torn
up
from
her
rotting
liver
by
fits
of
loud
groaning
vomiting
buck
mulligan
wiped
again
his
razorblade
poor
dogsbody
he
said
in
a
kind
voice
i
must
give
you
a
shirt
and
a
few
noserags
how

the
secondhand
breeks

stephen
answered
buck
mulligan
attacked
the
hollow
beneath
his
underlip
mockery
of
it
he
said
contentedly

stephen
said

buck
mulligan
told
his
face
in
the
mirror
etiquette

etiquette

kills
his
mother
but
he
can
t
wear
grey
trousers
he
folded
his
razor
neatly
and
with
stroking
palps
of
fingers
felt
the
smooth
skin
stephen
turned
his
gaze
from
the
sea
and
to
the
plump
face
with
its
smokeblue
mobile
eyes
fellow
i
was
with
in
the
ship

night
said
buck

up
in
dottyville
with
connolly
norman
general
paralysis
of
the
insane
he
swept
the
mirror
a
half
circle
in
the
air
to
flash
the
tidings
abroad
in
sunlight
now
radiant
on
the
sea
his
curling
shaven
lips
laughed
and
the
edges
of
his
white
glittering
teeth
laughter
seized
all
his
strong
wellknit
trunk
at
yourself
he
said
you
dreadful
bard
stephen
bent
forward
and
peered
at
the
mirror
held
out
to
him
cleft
by
a
crooked
crack
hair
on
end
as
he
and
others
see
me

not
into

and
her

laughing
again
he
brought
the
mirror
away
from
stephen
s
peering
eyes
rage
of
caliban
at
not
seeing
his
face
in
a
mirror
he
said
if
wilde
were
only
alive
to
see
you
drawing
back
and
pointing
stephen
said
with
bitterness
is
a
symbol
of
irish
art
the
cracked
lookingglass
of
a
servant
buck
mulligan
suddenly
linked
his
arm
in
stephen
s
and
walked
with
him
round
the
tower
his
razor
and
mirror
clacking
in
the
pocket
where
he
had
thrust
them
s
not
fair
to
tease
you
like

he
said
kindly

and

old
fellow

of

and

at

in

quadrangle
a
deaf
gardener
aproned
masked
with

on

lawn

omphalos
him

stephen
said
there
s
nothing
wrong
with
him
except
at
night
what
is
it
buck
mulligan
asked
impatiently
cough
it
up
i
m
quite
frank
with
you
what
have
you
against
me
now
they
halted
looking
towards
the
blunt
cape
of
bray
head
that
lay
on
the
water
like
the
snout
of
a
sleeping
whale
stephen
freed
his
arm
quietly
you
wish
me
to
tell
you
he
asked
what
is
it
buck
mulligan
answered
i
don
t
remember
anything
he
looked
in
stephen
s
face
as
he
spoke
a
light
wind
passed
his
brow
fanning
softly
his
fair
uncombed
hair
and
stirring
silver
points
of
anxiety
in
his
eyes
stephen
depressed
by
his
own
voice
said
you
remember
the
first
day
i
went
to
your
house
after
my
mother
s
death
buck
mulligan
frowned
quickly
and
said
where
i
can
t
remember
anything
i
remember
only
ideas
and
sensations
why
what
happened
in
the
name
of
god
were
making
tea
stephen
said
and
went
across
the
landing
to
get
more
hot
water
your
mother
and
some
visitor
came
out
of
the
drawingroom
she
asked
you
who
was
in
your
room
buck
mulligan
said
what
did
i
say
i
forget
said
stephen
answered
o
it
s
only
dedalus
whose
mother
is
beastly
dead
a
flush
which
made
him
seem
younger
and
more
engaging
rose
to
buck
mulligan
s
cheek
i
say
that
he
asked
well
what
harm
is
that
he
shook
his
constraint
from
him
nervously
what
is
death
he
asked
your
mother
s
or
yours
or
my
own
you
saw
only
your
mother
die
i
see
them
pop
off
every
day
in
the
mater
and
richmond
and
cut
up
into
tripes
in
the
dissectingroom
it
s
a
beastly
thing
and
nothing
else
it
simply
doesn
t
matter
you
wouldn
t
kneel
down
to
pray
for
your
mother
on
her
deathbed
when
she
asked
you
why
because
you
have
the
cursed
jesuit
strain
in
you
only
it
s
injected
the
wrong
way
to
me
it
s
all
a
mockery
and
beastly
her
cerebral
lobes
are
not
functioning
she
calls
the
doctor
sir
peter
teazle
and
picks
buttercups
off
the
quilt
humour
her
till
it
s
over
you
crossed
her
last
wish
in
death
and
yet
you
sulk
with
me
because
i
don
t
whinge
like
some
hired
mute
from
lalouette
s
absurd
i
suppose
i
did
say
it
i
didn
t
mean
to
offend
the
memory
of
your
mother
he
had
spoken
himself
into
boldness
stephen
shielding
the
gaping
wounds
which
the
words
had
left
in
his
heart
said
very
coldly
am
not
thinking
of
the
offence
to
my
mother
what
then
buck
mulligan
asked
the
offence
to
me
stephen
answered
buck
mulligan
swung
round
on
his
heel
an
impossible
person
he
exclaimed
he
walked
off
quickly
round
the
parapet
stephen
stood
at
his
post
gazing
over
the
calm
sea
towards
the
headland
sea
and
headland
now
grew
dim
pulses
were
beating
in
his
eyes
veiling
their
sight
and
he
felt
the
fever
of
his
cheeks
a
voice
within
the
tower
called
loudly
you
up
there
mulligan
m
coming
buck
mulligan
answered
he
turned
towards
stephen
and
said
at
the
sea
what
does
it
care
about
offences
chuck
loyola
kinch
and
come
on
down
the
sassenach
wants
his
morning
rashers
his
head
halted
again
for
a
moment
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
level
with
the
roof
t
mope
over
it
all
day
he
said
i
m
inconsequent
give
up
the
moody
brooding
his
head
vanished
but
the
drone
of
his
descending
voice
boomed
out
of
the
stairhead
and
no
more
turn
aside
and
brood
upon
love
s
bitter
mystery
for
fergus
rules
the
brazen
cars
woodshadows
floated
silently
by
through
the
morning
peace
from
the
stairhead
seaward
where
he
gazed
inshore
and
farther
out
the
mirror
of
water
whitened
spurned
by
lightshod
hurrying
feet
white
breast
of
the
dim
sea
the
twining
stresses
two
by
two
a
hand
plucking
the
harpstrings
merging
their
twining
chords
wavewhite
wedded
words
shimmering
on
the
dim
tide
a
cloud
began
to
cover
the
sun
slowly
wholly
shadowing
the
bay
in
deeper
green
it
lay
beneath
him
a
bowl
of
bitter
waters
fergus
song
i
sang
it
alone
in
the
house
holding
down
the
long
dark
chords
her
door
was
open
she
wanted
to
hear
my
music
silent
with
awe
and
pity
i
went
to
her
bedside
she
was
crying
in
her
wretched
bed
for
those
words
stephen
love
s
bitter
mystery
where
now
her
secrets
old
featherfans
tasselled
dancecards
powdered
with
musk
a
gaud
of
amber
beads
in
her
locked
drawer
a
birdcage
hung
in
the
sunny
window
of
her
house
when
she
was
a
girl
she
heard
old
royce
sing
in
the
pantomime
of
turko
the
terrible
and
laughed
with
others
when
he
sang
i
am
the
boy
that
can
enjoy
invisibility
phantasmal
mirth
folded
away
muskperfumed
and
no
more
turn
aside
and
brood
folded
away
in
the
memory
of
nature
with
her
toys
memories
beset
his
brooding
brain
her
glass
of
water
from
the
kitchen
tap
when
she
had

pique
my
curiosity
haines
said
amiably
is
it
some
paradox
buck
mulligan
said
we
have
grown
out
of
wilde
and
paradoxes
it
s
quite
simple
he
proves
by
algebra
that
hamlet
s
grandson
is
shakespeare
s
grandfather
and
that
he
himself
is
the
ghost
of
his
own
father
haines
said
beginning
to
point
at
stephen
he
himself
buck
mulligan
slung
his
towel
stolewise
round
his
neck
and
bending
in
loose
laughter
said
to
stephen
s
ear
shade
of
kinch
the
elder
japhet
in
search
of
a
father
re
always
tired
in
the
morning
stephen
said
to
haines
and
it
is
rather
long
to
tell
buck
mulligan
walking
forward
again
raised
his
hands
sacred
pint
alone
can
unbind
the
tongue
of
dedalus
he
said
mean
to
say
haines
explained
to
stephen
as
they
followed
this
tower
and
these
cliffs
here
remind
me
somehow
of
elsinore
that
beetles
o
er
his
base
into
the
sea
isn
t
it
buck
mulligan
turned
suddenly
for
an
instant
towards
stephen
but
did
not
speak
in
the
bright
silent
instant
stephen
saw
his
own
image
in
cheap
dusty
mourning
between
their
gay
attires
s
a
wonderful
tale
haines
said
bringing
them
to
halt
again
eyes
pale
as
the
sea
the
wind
had
freshened
paler
firm
and
prudent
the

ruler
he
gazed
southward
over
the
bay
empty
save
for
the
smokeplume
of
the
mailboat
vague
on
the
bright
skyline
and
a
sail
tacking
by
the
muglins
read
a
theological
interpretation
of
it
somewhere
he
said
bemused
the
father
and
the
son
idea
the
son
striving
to
be
atoned
with
the
father
buck
mulligan
at
once
put
on
a
blithe
broadly
smiling
face
he
looked
at
them
his
wellshaped
mouth
open
happily
his
eyes
from
which
he
had
suddenly
withdrawn
all
shrewd
sense
blinking
with
mad
gaiety
he
moved
a
doll
s
head
to
and
fro
the
brims
of
his
panama
hat
quivering
and
began
to
chant
in
a
quiet
happy
foolish
voice
m
the
queerest
young
fellow
that
ever
you
heard
my
mother
s
a
jew
my
father
s
a
bird
with
joseph
the
joiner
i
can
not
agree
so
here
s
to
disciples
and
calvary
he
held
up
a
forefinger
of
warning
anyone
thinks
that
i
amn
t
divine
he
ll
get
no
free
drinks
when
i
m
making
the
wine
but
have
to
drink
water
and
wish
it
were
plain
that
i
make
when
the
wine
becomes
water
again
he
tugged
swiftly
at
stephen
s
ashplant
in
farewell
and
running
forward
to
a
brow
of
the
cliff
fluttered
his
hands
at
his
sides
like
fins
or
wings
of
one
about
to
rise
in
the
air
and
chanted
now
goodbye
write
down
all
i
said
and
tell
tom
dick
and
harry
i
rose
from
the
dead
what
s
bred
in
the
bone
can
not
fail
me
to
fly
and
olivet
s
breezy
goodbye
now
goodbye
he
capered
before
them
down
towards
the
fortyfoot
hole
fluttering
his
winglike
hands
leaping
nimbly
mercury
s
hat
quivering
in
the
fresh
wind
that
bore
back
to
them
his
brief
birdsweet
cries
haines
who
had
been
laughing
guardedly
walked
on
beside
stephen
and
said
oughtn
t
to
laugh
i
suppose
he
s
rather
blasphemous
i
m
not
a
believer
myself
that
is
to
say
still
his
gaiety
takes
the
harm
out
of
it
somehow
doesn
t
it
what
did
he
call
it
joseph
the
joiner
ballad
of
joking
jesus
stephen
answered
haines
said
you
have
heard
it
before
times
a
day
after
meals
stephen
said
drily
re
not
a
believer
are
you
haines
asked
i
mean
a
believer
in
the
narrow
sense
of
the
word
creation
from
nothing
and
miracles
and
a
personal
god
s
only
one
sense
of
the
word
it
seems
to
me
stephen
said
haines
stopped
to
take
out
a
smooth
silver
case
in
which
twinkled
a
green
stone
he
sprang
it
open
with
his
thumb
and
offered
it
you
stephen
said
taking
a
cigarette
haines
helped
himself
and
snapped
the
case
to
he
put
it
back
in
his
sidepocket
and
took
from
his
waistcoatpocket
a
nickel
tinderbox
sprang
it
open
too
and
having
lit
his
cigarette
held
the
flaming
spunk
towards
stephen
in
the
shell
of
his
hands
of
course
he
said
as
they
went
on
again
either
you
believe
or
you
don
t
isn
t
it
personally
i
couldn
t
stomach
that
idea
of
a
personal
god
you
don
t
stand
for
that
i
suppose
behold
in
me
stephen
said
with
grim
displeasure
a
horrible
example
of
free
thought
he
walked
on
waiting
to
be
spoken
to
trailing
his
ashplant
by
his
side
its
ferrule
followed
lightly
on
the
path
squealing
at
his
heels
my
familiar
after
me
calling
steeeeeeeeeeeephen
a
wavering
line
along
the
path
they
will
walk
on
it
tonight
coming
here
in
the
dark
he
wants
that
key
it
is
mine
i
paid
the
rent
now
i
eat
his
salt
bread
give
him
the
key
too
all
he
will
ask
for
it
that
was
in
his
eyes
all
haines
began
stephen
turned
and
saw
that
the
cold
gaze
which
had
measured
him
was
not
all
unkind
all
i
should
think
you
are
able
to
free
yourself
you
are
your
own
master
it
seems
to
me
am
a
servant
of
two
masters
stephen
said
an
english
and
an
italian
haines
said
a
crazy
queen
old
and
jealous
kneel
down
before
me
a
third
stephen
said
there
is
who
wants
me
for
odd
jobs
haines
said
again
what
do
you
mean
imperial
british
state
stephen
answered
his
colour
rising
and
the
holy
roman
catholic
and
apostolic
church
haines
detached
from
his
underlip
some
fibres
of
tobacco
before
he
spoke
can
quite
understand
that
he
said
calmly
an
irishman
must
think
like
that
i
daresay
we
feel
in
england
that
we
have
treated
you
rather
unfairly
it
seems
history
is
to
blame
the
proud
potent
titles
clanged
over
stephen
s
memory
the
triumph
of
their
brazen
bells
et
unam
sanctam
catholicam
et
apostolicam
ecclesiam
the
slow
growth
and
change
of
rite
and
dogma
like
his
own
rare
thoughts
a
chemistry
of
stars
symbol
of
the
apostles
in
the
mass
for
pope
marcellus
the
voices
blended
singing
alone
loud
in
affirmation
and
behind
their
chant
the
vigilant
angel
of
the
church
militant
disarmed
and
menaced
her
heresiarchs
a
horde
of
heresies
fleeing
with
mitres
awry
photius
and
the
brood
of
mockers
of
whom
mulligan
was
one
and
arius
warring
his
life
long
upon
the
consubstantiality
of
the
son
with
the
father
and
valentine
spurning
christ
s
terrene
body
and
the
subtle
african
heresiarch
sabellius
who
held
that
the
father
was
himself
his

son
words
mulligan
had
spoken
a
moment
since
in
mockery
to
the
stranger
idle
mockery
the
void
awaits
surely
all
them
that
weave
the

a
menace
a
disarming
and
a
worsting
from

embattled

towards

yet
it

deftly
amid

on
talbot
a
swarthy
boy
opened
a
book
and
propped
it
nimbly
under
the
breastwork
of
his

he
recited
jerks
of

with
odd

at

your

formed
itself
within
the
gabbled

and
floated
out
into

of

quietly

sir
talbot
asked
simply
bending
forward
his
hand
turned
the
page
over
he
leaned
back
and
went
on
again
having
just
remembered
of
him
that
walked
the

here
also
over
these
craven
hearts

shadow
lies
and
on

they

stephen
said
the
cock
crew
the
sky
was
blue
the
bells
in

were
striking
eleven
tis
time
for
this
poor
soul
to
go
to

what
is
that
sir
sir
we
didn

hear
their
eyes
grew
bigger
as
the
lines
were
repeated
after
a
silence
cochrane
said
is

sir
we
give
it
up
stephen
his
throat
itching
answered
fox
burying
his
grandmother
under
a
hollybush
he
stood
up
and
gave
a
shout
of
nervous
laughter
to
which
their
cries
echoed
dismay
a
stick
struck
the
door
and
a
voice
in
the
corridor
called
they
broke
asunder
sidling
out
of
their
benches
leaping
them
quickly
they
were
gone
and
from
the
lumberroom
came
the
rattle
of
sticks
and
clamour
of
their
boots
and
tongues
sargent
who
alone
had
lingered
came
forward
slowly
showing
an
open
copybook
his
tangled
hair
and
scraggy
neck
gave
witness
of
unreadiness
and
through
his
misty
glasses
weak
eyes
looked
up
pleading
on
his
cheek
dull
and
bloodless
a
soft
stain
of
ink
lay
dateshaped
recent
and
damp
as
a
snail
s
bed
he
held
out
his
copybook
the
word
sums
was
written
on
the
headline
beneath
were
sloping
figures
and
at
the
foot
a
crooked
signature
with
blind
loops
and
a
blot
cyril
sargent
his
name
and
seal
deasy
told
me
to
write
them
out
all
again
he
said
and
show
them
to
you
sir
stephen
touched
the
edges
of
the
book
futility
you
understand
how
to
do
them
now
he
asked
eleven
to
fifteen
sargent
answered
mr
deasy
said
i
was
to
copy
them
off
the
board
sir
you
do
them
yourself
stephen
asked
sir
ugly
and
futile
lean
neck
and
tangled
hair
and
a
stain
of
ink
a
snail
s
bed
yet
someone
had
loved
him
borne
him
in
her
arms
and
in
her
heart
but
for
her
the
race
of
the
world
would
have
trampled
him
underfoot
a
squashed
boneless
snail
she
had
loved
his
weak
watery
blood
drained
from
her
own
was
that
then
real
the
only
true
thing
in
life
his
mother
s
prostrate
body
the
fiery
columbanus
in
holy
zeal
bestrode
she
was
no
more
the
trembling
skeleton
of
a
twig
burnt
in
the
fire
an
odour
of
rosewood
and
wetted
ashes
she
had
saved
him
from
being
trampled
underfoot
and
had
gone
scarcely
having
been
a
poor
soul
gone
to
heaven
and
on
a
heath
beneath
winking
stars
a
fox
red
reek
of
rapine
in
his
fur
with
merciless
bright
eyes
scraped
in
the
earth
listened
scraped
up
the
earth
listened
scraped
and
scraped
sitting
at
his
side
stephen
solved
out
the
problem
he
proves
by
algebra
that
shakespeare
s
ghost
is
hamlet
s
grandfather
sargent
peered
askance
through
his
slanted
glasses
hockeysticks
rattled
in
the
lumberroom
the
hollow
knock
of
a
ball
and
calls
from
the
field
across
the
page
the
symbols
moved
in
grave
morrice
in
the
mummery
of
their
letters
wearing
quaint
caps
of
squares
and
cubes
give
hands
traverse
bow
to
partner
so
imps
of
fancy
of
the
moors
gone
too
from
the
world
averroes
and
moses
maimonides
dark
men
in
mien
and
movement
flashing
in
their
mocking
mirrors
the
obscure
soul
of
the
world
a
darkness
shining
in
brightness
which
brightness
could
not
comprehend
you
understand
now
can
you
work
the
second
for
yourself
sir
in
long
shaky
strokes
sargent
copied
the
data
waiting
always
for
a
word
of
help
his
hand
moved
faithfully
the
unsteady
symbols
a
faint
hue
of
shame
flickering
behind
his
dull
skin
amor
matris
subjective
and
objective
genitive
with
her
weak
blood
and
wheysour
milk
she
had
fed
him
and
hid
from
sight
of
others
his
swaddling
bands
like
him
was
i
these
sloping
shoulders
this
gracelessness
my
childhood
bends
beside
me
too
far
for
me
to
lay
a
hand
there
once
or
lightly
mine
is
far
and
his
secret
as
our
eyes
secrets
silent
stony
sit
in
the
dark
palaces
of
both
our
hearts
secrets
weary
of
their
tyranny
tyrants
willing
to
be
dethroned
the
sum
was
done
is
very
simple
stephen
said
as
he
stood
up
sir
thanks
sargent
answered
he
dried
the
page
with
a
sheet
of
thin
blottingpaper
and
carried
his
copybook
back
to
his
bench
had
better
get
your
stick
and
go
out
to
the
others
stephen
said
as
he
followed
towards
the
door
the
boy
s
graceless
form
sir
in
the
corridor
his
name
was
heard
called
from
the
playfield
on
stephen
said
mr
deasy
is
calling
you
he
stood
in
the
porch
and
watched
the
laggard
hurry
towards
the
scrappy
field
where
sharp
voices
were
in
strife
they
were
sorted
in
teams
and
mr
deasy
came
away
stepping
over
wisps
of
grass
with
gaitered
feet
when
he
had
reached
the
schoolhouse
voices
again
contending
called
to
him
he
turned
his
angry
white
moustache
is
it
now
he
cried
continually
without
listening
and
halliday
are
on
the
same
side
sir
stephen
said
you
wait
in
my
study
for
a
moment
mr
deasy
said
till
i
restore
order
here
and
as
he
stepped
fussily
back
across
the
field
his
old
man
s
voice
cried
sternly
is
the
matter
what
is
it
now
their
sharp
voices
cried
about
him
on
all
sides
their
many
forms
closed
round
him
the
garish
sunshine
bleaching
the
honey
of
his
illdyed
head
stale
smoky
air
hung
in
the
study
with
the
smell
of
drab
abraded
leather
of
its
chairs
as
on
the
first
day
he
bargained
with
me
here
as
it
was
in
the
beginning
is
now
on
the
sideboard
the
tray
of
stuart
coins
base
treasure
of
a
bog
and
ever
shall
be
and
snug
in
their
spooncase
of
purple
plush
faded
the
twelve
apostles
having
preached
to
all
the
gentiles
world
without
end
a
hasty
step
over
the
stone
porch
and
in
the
corridor
blowing
out
his
rare
moustache
mr
deasy
halted
at
the
table
our
little
financial
settlement
he
said
he
brought
out
of
his
coat
a
pocketbook
bound
by
a
leather
thong
it
slapped
open
and
he
took
from
it
two
notes
one
of
joined
halves
and
laid
them
carefully
on
the
table
he
said
strapping
and
stowing
his
pocketbook
away
and
now
his
strongroom
for
the
gold
stephen
s
embarrassed
hand
moved
over
the
shells
heaped
in
the
cold
stone
mortar
whelks
and
money
cowries
and
leopard
shells
and
this
whorled
as
an
emir

and
this

s
hoard
dead

hollow
shells
a
sovereign
fell
bright
and
new
on
the
soft
pile
of
the
tablecloth
mr
deasy
said
turning
his
little
savingsbox
about
in
his
hand
these
are
handy
things
to
have
see
this
is
for
sovereigns
this
is
for
shillings
sixpences
halfcrowns
and
here

he
shot
from
it
two
crowns
and
two
shillings
twelve
he
said
i
think
you
ll
find
that
s
right
you
sir
stephen
said
gathering
the
money
together
with
shy
haste
and
putting
it
all
in
a
pocket
of
his
trousers
thanks
at
all
mr
deasy
said
you
have
earned
it
stephen
s
hand
free
again
went
back
to
the
hollow
shells
symbols
too
of
beauty
and
of
power
a
lump
in
my
pocket
symbols
soiled
by
greed
and
misery
t
carry
it
like
that
mr
deasy
said
you
ll
pull
it
out
somewhere
and
lose
it
you
just
buy
one
of
these
machines
you
ll
find
them
very
handy
answer
something
would
be
often
empty
stephen
said
the
same
room
and
hour
the
same
wisdom
and
i
the
same
three
times
now

nooses
round
me
here

instant

murmured
he
lifted
his
gaze
from
the
idle
shells
to
the
old
man
s
stare
knew
what
money
was
mr
deasy
said
he
made
money
a
poet
yes
but
an
englishman
too
do
you
know
what
is
the
pride
of
the
english
do
you

from
an
englishman

the

his

looked
on

stephen
said

laughed
with

putting

knew
you

he
said
joyously
but
one
day
you
must
feel
it
we

people
but
we
must
also
be
just
fear
those
big
words
stephen
said
which
make
us
so
unhappy
mr
deasy
stared
sternly
for
some
moments
over

at

of

he
went
to
the
desk
near
the
window
pulled
in
his
chair
twice
and
read
off
some
words
from
the
sheet
on
the
drum
of
his
typewriter
down
excuse
me
he
said
over
his
shoulder
the
dictates
of
common

just
a
moment
he
peered
from
under
his
shaggy
brows
at
the

by

and
muttering

to
prod
the

screwed
up

passed
a
broad
sunbeam
he
faced
about
and
back
again
he
said
again
if
not
dead
by
now
the
harlot
s
cry
from
street
to
street
shall
weave
old
england
s
windingsheet
his
eyes
open
wide
in
vision
stared
sternly
across
the
sunbeam
in
which
he
halted
merchant
stephen
said
is
one
who
buys
cheap
and
sells
dear
jew
or
gentile
is
he
not
sinned
against
the
light
mr
deasy
said
gravely
and
you
can
see
the
darkness
in
their
eyes
and
that
is
why
they
are
wanderers
on
the
earth
to
this
day
on
the
steps
of
the
paris
stock
exchange
the
goldskinned
men
quoting
prices
on
their
gemmed
fingers
gabble
of
geese
they
swarmed
loud
uncouth
about
the
temple
their
heads
thickplotting
under
maladroit
silk
hats
not
theirs
these
clothes
this
speech
these
gestures
their
full
slow
eyes
belied
the
words
the
gestures
eager
and
unoffending
but
knew
the
rancours
massed
about
them
and
knew
their
zeal
was
vain
vain
patience
to
heap
and
hoard
time
surely
would
scatter
all
a
hoard
heaped
by
the
roadside
plundered
and
passing
on
their
eyes
knew
their
years
of
wandering
and
patient
knew
the
dishonours
of
their
flesh
has
not
stephen
said
do
you
mean
mr
deasy
asked
he
came
forward
a
pace
and
stood
by
the
table
his
underjaw
fell
sideways
open
uncertainly
is
this
old
wisdom
he
waits
to
hear
from
me
stephen
said
is
a
nightmare
from
which
i
am
trying
to
awake
from
the
playfield
the
boys
raised
a
shout
a
whirring
whistle
goal
what
if
that
nightmare
gave
you
a
back
kick
ways
of
the
creator
are
not
our
ways
mr
deasy
said
all
human
history
moves
towards
one
great
goal
the
manifestation
of
god
stephen
jerked
his
thumb
towards
the
window
saying
is
god
hooray
ay
whrrwhee
mr
deasy
asked
shout
in
the
street
stephen
answered
shrugging
his
shoulders
mr
deasy
looked
down
and
held
for
awhile
the
wings
of
his
nose
tweaked
between
his
fingers
looking
up
again
he
set
them
free
am
happier
than
you
are
he
said
we
have
committed
many
errors
and
many
sins
a
woman
brought
sin
into
the
world
for
a
woman
who
was
no
better
than
she
should
be
helen
the
runaway
wife
of
menelaus
ten
years
the
greeks
made
war
on
troy
a
faithless
wife
first
brought
the
strangers
to
our
shore
here
macmurrough
s
wife
and
her
leman
o
rourke
prince
of
breffni
a
woman
too
brought
parnell
low
many
errors
many
failures
but
not
the
one
sin
i
am
a
struggler
now
at
the
end
of
my
days
but
i
will
fight
for
the
right
till
the
end
for
ulster
will
fight
and
ulster
will
be
right
stephen
raised
the
sheets
in
his
hand
sir
he
began
foresee
mr
deasy
said
that
you
will
not
remain
here
very
long
at
this
work
you
were
not
born
to
be
a
teacher
i
think
perhaps
i
am
wrong
learner
rather
stephen
said
and
here
what
will
you
learn
more
mr
deasy
shook
his
head
knows
he
said
to
learn
one
must
be
humble
but
life
is
the
great
teacher
stephen
rustled
the
sheets
again
regards
these
he
began
mr
deasy
said
you
have
two
copies

you
can
have
them
published

said
and

briskly
i

letter
from
my
cousin

sir
stephen
said
putting
the
sheets
in
his
pocket
thank

all
mr
deasy
said
as
he
searched
the
papers
on
his
desk
i
like
to
break
a
lance
with
you
old
as
i
am
morning
sir
stephen
said
again
bowing
to
his
bent
back
he
went
out
by
the
open
porch
and
down
the
gravel
path
under
the
trees
hearing
the
cries
of
voices
and
crack
of
sticks
from
the
playfield
the
lions
couchant
on
the
pillars
as
he
passed
out
through
the
gate
toothless
terrors
still
i
will
help
him
in
his
fight
mulligan
will
dub
me
a
new
name

bullockbefriending
bard
dedalus
running
after
me
no
more
letters

hope
one
moment
sir
stephen
said
turning
back
at
the
gate
mr
deasy
halted
breathing
hard
and
swallowing
his
breath
just
wanted
to
say
he
said
ireland
they
say
has
the
honour
of
being
the
only
country
which
never
persecuted
the
jews
do
you
know
that
no
and
do
you
know
why
he
frowned
sternly
on
the
bright
air
sir
stephen
asked
beginning
to
smile
she
never
let
them
in
mr
deasy
said
solemnly
a
coughball
of
laughter
leaped
from
his
throat
dragging
after
it
a
rattling
chain
of
phlegm
he
turned
back
quickly
coughing
laughing
his
lifted
arms
waving
to
the
air
never
let
them
in
he
cried
again
through
his
laughter
as
he
stamped
on
gaitered
feet
over
the
gravel
of
the
path
that
s
why
on
his

fried

most
of

he
liked
grilled
mutton
kidneys
which
gave
to
his
palate
a
fine
tang
of
faintly
scented
urine
kidneys
were
in
his
mind
as
he
moved
about
the
kitchen
softly
righting
her
breakfast
things
on
the
humpy
tray
gelid
light
and
air
were
in
the
kitchen
but
out
of
doors
gentle
summer
morning
everywhere
made
him
feel
a
bit
peckish
the
coals
were
reddening
another
slice
of
bread
and
butter
three
four
right
she
didn
t
like
her
plate
full
right
he
turned
from
the
tray
lifted
the
kettle
off
the
hob
and
set
it
sideways
on
the
fire
it
sat
there
dull
and
squat
its
spout
stuck
out
cup
of
tea
soon
good
mouth
dry
the
cat
walked
stiffly
round
a
leg
of
the
table
with
tail
on
high
there
you
are
mr
bloom
said
turning
from
the
fire
the
cat
mewed
in
answer
and
stalked
again
stiffly
round
a
leg
of
the
table
mewing
just
how
she
stalks
over
my
writingtable
prr
scratch
my
head
prr
mr
bloom
watched
curiously
kindly
the
lithe
black
form
clean
to
see
the
gloss
of
her
sleek
hide
the
white
button
under
the
butt
of
her
tail
the
green
flashing
eyes
he
bent
down
to
her
his
hands
on
his
knees
for
the
pussens
he
said
the
cat
cried
they
call
them
stupid
they
understand
what
we
say
better
than
we
understand
them
she
understands
all
she
wants
to
vindictive
too
cruel
her
nature
curious
mice
never
squeal
seem
to
like
it
wonder
what
i
look
like
to
her
height
of
a
tower
no
she
can
jump
me
of
the
chickens
she
is
he
said
mockingly
afraid
of
the
chookchooks
i
never
saw
such
a
stupid
pussens
as
the
pussens
the
cat
said
loudly
she
blinked
up
out
of
her
avid
shameclosing
eyes
mewing
plaintively
and
long
showing
him
her
milkwhite
teeth
he
watched
the
dark
eyeslits
narrowing
with
greed
till
her
eyes
were
green
stones
then
he
went
to
the
dresser
took
the
jug
hanlon
s
milkman
had
just
filled
for
him
poured
warmbubbled
milk
on
a
saucer
and
set
it
slowly
on
the
floor
she
cried
running
to
lap
he
watched
the
bristles
shining
wirily
in
the
weak
light
as
she
tipped
three
times
and
licked
lightly
wonder
is
it
true
if
you
clip
them
they
can
t
mouse
after
why
they
shine
in
the
dark
perhaps
the
tips
or
kind
of
feelers
in
the
dark
perhaps
he
listened
to
her
licking
lap
ham
and
eggs
no
no
good
eggs
with
this
drouth
want
pure
fresh
water
thursday
not
a

either
for

kidney
at

s
fried
with

a
shake
of
pepper
better
a
pork
kidney
at
dlugacz
s
while
the
kettle
is
boiling
she
lapped
slower
then
licking
the
saucer
clean
why
are
their
tongues
so
rough
to
lap
better
all
porous
holes
nothing
she
can
eat
he
glanced
round
him
no
on
quietly
creaky
boots
he
went
up
the
staircase
to
the
hall
paused
by
the
bedroom
door
she
might
like
something
tasty
thin
bread
and
butter
she
likes
in
the
morning
still
perhaps
once
in
a
way
he
said
softly
in
the
bare
hall
m
going
round
the
corner
be
back
in
a
minute
and
when
he
had
heard
his
voice
say
it
he
added
don
t
want
anything
for
breakfast
a
sleepy
soft
grunt
answered
no
she
didn
t
want
anything
he
heard
then
a
warm
heavy
sigh
softer
as
she
turned
over
and
the
loose
brass
quoits
of
the
bedstead
jingled
must
get
those
settled
really
pity
all
the
way
from
gibraltar
forgotten

what
her

gave
for

from

and
i

proud
of
it
still
he
had

enough
to
make
that
corner
in

now
that
was

took
his

dropped
gently
over

asked

the

propped
on
her

got
the
things
she
said
he
waited
till
she
had
laid
the
card
aside
and
curled
herself
back
slowly
with
a
snug
sigh
up
with
that
tea
she
said
i
m
parched
kettle

boiling
he
said
but
he
delayed
to
clear
the
chair
her
striped
petticoat
tossed
soiled
linen
and
lifted
all
in
an
armful
on
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
as
he
went
down
the
kitchen
stairs
she
called
the
teapot
on
the
boil
sure
enough
a
plume
of
steam
from
the
spout
he
scalded
and
rinsed
out
the
teapot
and
put
in
four
full
spoons
of
tea
tilting
the
kettle
then
to
let
the
water
flow
in
having
set
it
to
draw
he
took
off
the
kettle
crushed
the
pan
flat
on
the
live
coals
and
watched
the
lump
of
butter
slide
and
melt
while
he
unwrapped
the

hungrily
against
him

let

her
and
dropped
the

amid
the
sizzling

he
sprinkled
it
through

said
she
set
the
brasses
jingling
as
she
raised
herself
briskly
an
elbow
on
the
pillow
he
looked
calmly
down
on
her
bulk
and
between
her
large
soft
bubs
sloping
within
her
nightdress
like
a
shegoat
s
udder
the
warmth
of
her
couched
body
rose
on
the
air
mingling
with
the
fragrance
of
the
tea
she
poured
a
strip
of
torn
envelope
peeped
from
under
the
dimpled
pillow
in
the
act
of
going
he
stayed
to

she
doubled
a

into
her

asking
time

he
answered
i
didn

see
the

following
the
pointing
of
her

he
took
up
a
leg
of
her
soiled

she
swallowed
a
draught
of

from
her
cup
held
by
nothandle
and
having
wiped
her
fingertips
smartly
on
the
blanket
began
to

with
the
hairpin
till
she
reached
the
word
him
what
he
asked
she
said

does
that

he
leaned
downward
and
read

he
turned
the

back
he
said

what
the
ancient
greeks
called
it
they
used
to
believe
you
could
be
changed
into
an
animal
or
a
tree
for
instance
what
they
called
nymphs
for
example
her
spoon
ceased
to
stir
up
the
sugar
she
gazed
straight
before
her
inhaling
through
her
arched
nostrils
s
a
smell
of
burn
she
said
did
you
leave
anything
on
the
fire
kidney
he
cried
suddenly
he
fitted
the
book
roughly
into
his
inner
pocket
and
stubbing
his
toes
against
the
broken
commode
hurried
out
towards
the
smell
stepping
hastily
down
the
stairs
with
a
flurried
stork
s
legs
pungent
smoke
shot
up
in
an
angry
jet
from
a
side
of
the
pan
by
prodding
a
prong
of
the
fork
under
the
kidney
he
detached
it
and
turned
it
turtle
on
its
back
only
a
little
burnt
he
tossed
it
off
the
pan
on
to
a
plate
and
let
the
scanty
brown
gravy
trickle
over
it
cup
of
tea
now
he
sat
down
cut
and
buttered
a
slice
of
the
loaf
he
shore
away
the
burnt
flesh
and
flung
it
to
the
cat
then
he
put
a
forkful
into
his
mouth
chewing
with
discernment
the
toothsome
pliant
meat
done
to
a
turn
a
mouthful
of
tea
then
he
cut
away
dies
of
bread
sopped
one
in
the
gravy
and
put
it
in
his
mouth
what
was
that
about
some
young
student
and
a
picnic
he
creased
out
the
letter
at
his
side
reading
it
slowly
as
he
chewed
sopping
another
die
of
bread
in
the
gravy
and
raising
it
to
his
mouth

dirty
for

he
went
in
bowing
his
head
under
the
low
lintel
leaving
the
door
ajar
amid
the
stench
of
mouldy
limewash
and
stale
cobwebs
he
undid
his
braces
before
sitting
down
he
peered
through
a
chink
up
at
the
nextdoor
windows
the

was
in

nobody
asquat
on

his

he
allowed
his

it
was
something
quick
and
neat

anything
now
silly

he
read
on
seated
calm
above
his
own
rising

neat
certainly
matcham
often
thinks
of
the

by
which
he
won
the
laughing

who
now
begins
and
ends
morally

smart
he
glanced
back
through
what
he
had
read
and
while
feeling
his
water
flow
quietly
he
envied
kindly
mr

had

sharply
and

with

then
he
girded
up
his

braced
and
buttoned
himself
he
pulled
back

of

and
came

the

and
past

he
turned
from
the

noises
of
the
quayside
and
walked
through
lime
street
by
brady

a

for

lolled
his

of

linked
smoking
a

a

couldn

ask
him
at
a
funeral
though
while
his
eyes
still
read
blandly
he
took
off
his
hat
quietly
inhaling
his
hairoil
and
sent
his
right
hand
with
slow
grace
over
his
brow
and
hair
very
warm
morning
under
their
dropped
lids
his
eyes
found
the
tiny
bow
of
the
leather
headband
inside
his
high
grade
ha
just
there
his
right
hand
came
down
into
the
bowl
of
his
hat
his
fingers
found
quickly
a
card
behind
the
headband
and
transferred
it
to
his
waistcoat
pocket
so
warm
his
right
hand
once
more
more
slowly
went
over
his
brow
and
hair
then
he
put
on
his

again
relieved
and
read

floating
on

reading
a

turned
away
and
sauntered
across
the

took
the

searched
a
pigeonhole
he
gazed
at
the

with

of

on
parade
and
held
the
tip
of
his

against
his

went
too

last
time
the

handed
him
back
through

his

and
turned
to
the
right
talk
as
if
that
would
mend
matters
his
hand
went
into
his

and
a

felt
its

of

going

to
talk
of

in
that
outside

blind
abraham
recognises
the
voice
and
puts
his
fingers
on
his
face
nathan
s
voice
his
son
s
voice
i
hear
the
voice
of
nathan
who
left
his
father
to
die
of
grief
and
misery
in
my
arms
who
left
the
house
of
his
father
and
left
the

of
his
father

is
so
deep
leopold
poor

ffoo
well
perhaps
it
was
best
for
him
mr

went
round
the
corner
and
passed
the
drooping
nags
of
the
hazard
no
use
thinking
of
it
any
more
nosebag
time
wish
i
hadn
t
met
that
m
coy
fellow
he
came
nearer
and
heard
a
crunching
of
gilded
oats
the
gently
champing
teeth
their
full
buck
eyes
regarded
him
as
he
went
by
amid
the
sweet
oaten
reek
of
horsepiss
their
eldorado
poor
jugginses
damn
all
they
know
or
care
about
anything
with
their
long
noses
stuck
in
nosebags
too
full
for
words
still
they
get
their
feed
all
right
and
their
doss
gelded
too
a
stump
of
black
guttapercha
wagging
limp
between
their
haunches
might
be
happy
all
the
same
that
way
good
poor
brutes
they
look
still
their
neigh
can
be
very
irritating
he
drew
the
letter
from
his
pocket
and
folded
it
into
the
newspaper
he
carried
might
just
walk
into
her
here
the
lane

passed
the
cabman

shelter
curious
the
life
of
drifting
cabbies
all
weathers
all
places
time
or
setdown
no
will
of

of
the

and
placed
it
in
his
heart
pocket
language
of
flowers
they
like
it
because

hear
or
a
poison
bouquet
to
strike
him

pin
out
of
it
common
pin

threw
it
on
the
road
out
of
her
clothes
somewhere
pinned
together
queer
the
number
of

they
always
have
no
roses
without

flat
dublin
voices
bawled
in

linked
together
in
the
rain
o
mairy
lost
the

down

he
approached
a

then
he
tossed
off

then
all
settled
down

he
sat
back
quietly
in

the

came
down
from
the

holding
the

out
from

from

round

house
showed
them
a
curved

open
on

after

and
said
mildly

mr

collapsing
in
laughter
shaded
his
face
from
the
window
as

martin
cunningham
said
broadly
his
eyes
met
mr

eyes
he
caressed
his
beard
adding
nearly
all
of
us
mr
bloom
began
to
speak
with
sudden
eagerness
to
his
companions
faces
s
an
awfully
good
one
that
s
going
the
rounds
about
reuben
j
and
the
son
the
boatman
mr

asked
isn
t
it
awfully
good
is
that
mr
dedalus
asked
i
didn
t
hear
it
was
a
girl
in
the
case
mr
bloom
began
and
he
determined
to
send
him
to
the
isle
of
man
out
of
harm
s
way
but
when
they
were
both
mr
dedalus
asked
that
confirmed
bloody
hobbledehoy
is
it
mr
bloom
said
they
were
both
on
the
way
to
the
boat
and
he
tried
to
drown
barabbas
mr
dedalus
cried
i
wish
to
christ
he
did
mr
power
sent
a
long
laugh
down
his
shaded
nostrils
mr
bloom
said
the
son
himself
martin
cunningham
thwarted
his
speech
rudely
j
and
the
son
were
piking
it
down
the
quay
next
the
river
on
their
way
to
the
isle
of
man

and
the
young
chiseller
suddenly
got
loose
and
over
the
wall
with
him
into
the
liffey
god
s
sake
mr
dedalus
exclaimed
in
fright
is
he
dead
martin
cunningham
cried
not
he
a
boatman
got
a
pole
and
fished
him
out
by
the
slack
of
the
breeches
and
he
was
landed
up
to
the
father
on
the
quay
more
dead
than
alive
half
the
town
was
there
mr
bloom
said
but
the
funny
part
is
reuben
j
martin
cunningham
said
gave
the
boatman
a
florin
for
saving
his
son
s
life
a
stifled
sigh
came
from
under
mr
power
s
hand
he
did
martin
cunningham
affirmed
like
a
hero
a
silver
florin
t
it
awfully
good
mr
bloom
said
eagerly
and
eightpence
too
much
mr
dedalus

martin

said
mr

sighed
then
indeed
he
said
poor
little
paddy
wouldn
t
grudge
us
a
laugh
many
a
good
one
he
told
himself
lord
forgive
me
mr
power
said
wiping
his
wet
eyes
with
his
fingers
poor
paddy
i
little
thought
a
week
ago
when
i
saw
him
last
and
he
was
in
his

health
that
i
d
be
driving
after
him
like
this
he
s
gone
from

a
little
man
as
ever
wore

mr
dedalus
said
he
went
very
suddenly
martin

tapped

apprehension

mr

said
their

said
is
the
man
who

martin

drew
out

briskly
coughed
and
put
it
back
greatest
disgrace
to

mr

added
insanity
of

martin
cunningham
said
decisively
we
must
take
a
charitable
view
of
it
say
a
man
who
does
it
is
a
coward
mr
dedalus
said
is
not
for

martin

said
mr

about
to

again
martin
cunningham

large

looking
away
now
sympathetic
human

like

they
used
to
drive
a

of

through

as
if
it
wasn

broken
already
yet
sometimes
they
repent
too
late
found
in
the
riverbed
clutching

he
looked
at
me
and
that
awful
drunkard
of
a
wife
of
his
setting
up
house
for
her
time
after
time
and
then
pawning
the

on
him
every

capering
with

he
s
gone
over
to
the

they
told
me
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
the
carriage
galloped
round
a
corner
stopped
s
wrong
now
a
divided
drove
of
branded
cattle
passed
the
windows
lowing
slouching
by
on
padded

whisking
their

slowly
on
their
clotted
bony
croups
outside
them
and
through
them
ran

mr

huuuh

the
carriage
moved
on
through
the

can
t
make
out
why
the
corporation
doesn
t
run
a
tramline
from
the
parkgate
to
the

mr

said
all
those
animals
could
be
taken
in
trucks
down
to
the
boats
of
blocking
up
the
thoroughfare
martin
cunningham
said
quite
right
they
ought
to
mr
bloom
said
and
another
thing
i
often
thought
is
to
have
municipal
funeral
trams
like
they
have
in
milan
you
know
run
the
line
out
to
the
cemetery
gates
and
have
special
trams
hearse
and
carriage
and
all
don
t
you

mr

asked
turning

it
be
more
decent
than
galloping
two
abreast
there
s
something
in
that
mr
dedalus
granted
martin
cunningham
said
we
wouldn
t
have
scenes
like
that
when
the
hearse
capsized
round
dunphy

and
upset
the

on

mr

quite

would
he
bleed
if
a

cut
him
in

he

inclined
his

the

hung
his
thumbs
in
the
loops
of
his
gold

discreet
tone
to
their
vacant

tell
the

said
that

out
here
one
foggy

asked
for
mulcahy
from

he
was
buried
after

fog
they
found

sure
enough

of

drunks
spelt
out
the
name
terence
mulcahy
the
other

it
simply
swurls
those

gives
him
a

seeing

daren
t

about

for

at

de

go
out
of

hard
to
imagine
his

seems
a
sort
of
a
joke
read
your

obituary
notice
they
say
you
live
longer
gives
you
second

new
lease
of

have
you
for

the
caretaker
asked
corny
kelleher
said
half
ten
and
eleven
the
caretaker
put
the
papers
in
his
pocket
the
barrow
had
ceased
to
trundle
the
mourners
split
and
moved
to
each
side
of
the
hole
stepping
with
care
round
the
graves
the
gravediggers
bore
the
coffin
and
set
its
nose
on
the
brink
looping
the
bands
round
it
burying
him
we
come
to
bury
cæsar
his
ides
of
march
or

doesn
t
know
who
is
here
nor
care
now
who
is
that
lankylooking
galoot
over
there
in
the
macintosh
now
who
is
he
i
d
like
to
know
now
i
d
give
a
trifle
to
know
who
he
is
always
someone
turns
up
you
never
dreamt
of
a
fellow
could
live
on
his
lonesome
all
his
life
yes
he
could
still
he
d
have
to
get
someone
to
sod
him
after
he
died
though
he
could
dig
his
own
grave
we
all
do
only
man

first
thing

the
dead
say
robinson
crusoe

true
to
life

a
thursday
if
you
come
to
look
at
it
o
poor
robinson
crusoe
how
could
you
possibly
do
so
poor
dignam
his
last
lie
on
the
earth
in
his
box
when
you
think
of
them
all
it
does
seem
a
waste
of
wood
all
gnawed
through
they
could
invent
a
handsome
bier
with
a
kind
of
panel
sliding
let
it
down
that
way
ay
but
they
might
object
to
be
buried
out
of
another
fellow

so
particular

me
in
my
native
earth
bit
of

to
protect
him
as
long
as
possible
even
in
the
earth
the

eased
down
by
the
men
straddled
on
the
gravetrestles
they
struggled
up
and
out
and
all
uncovered

his
wreath
with
both
hands
staring
quietly
in

weighing
them
up
perhaps
to

it
off
on

dropping
into

the
repose
of
his
soul
hoping

out
of

few
paces
and
put
on
his
hat

enough
of
it
the
mourners
took
heart
of
grace
one
by
one
covering
themselves
without
show
mr
bloom
put
on
his
hat
and
saw
the
portly
figure
make
its
way
deftly
through
the
maze
of
graves
quietly
sure
of
his
ground
he
traversed
the
dismal
fields

began
to
be
seen
in
the
hole
it
rose
nearly
over
a
mound
of
damp
clods
rose
more
rose
and
the
gravediggers
rested
their
spades
all
uncovered
again
for
a
few
instants
the
boy
propped
his
wreath
against
a
corner
the
his
on
a
lump
the
gravediggers
put
on
their
caps
and
carried
their
earthy
spades
towards
the
barrow

knocked
the
blades
lightly
on
the
turf
clean
one
bent
to
pluck
from
the
haft
a
long
tuft
of
grass
one
leaving

handed
the

nannan
iron

maybe
he

what
i
the
foreman
turned
round
to
hear
patiently
and
lifting
an
elbow
began
to
scratch
slowly
in
the
armpit
of
his
alpaca
jacket
that
mr
bloom
said
crossing
his
forefingers
at
the
top
let
him
take
that
in
first
mr
bloom
glancing
sideways
up
from
the
cross
he
had
made
saw
the
foreman
s
sallow
face
think
he
has
a
touch
of
jaundice
and
beyond
the
obedient
reels
feeding
in
huge
webs
of
paper
clank
it
clank
it
miles
of
it
unreeled
what
becomes
of

after

wrap
up

things
slipping
his
words
deftly
into
the
pauses
of
the
clanking
he
drew
swiftly
on
the
scarred
woodwork
house
of
key
e
s
that
see
two
crossed
keys
here
a

then
here

merchant
so
on
better
not
teach
him
his

yourself
councillor
just
what
he
wants
then
round
the
top
in
leaded
the
house
of
keys
you
see
do
you
think
that
s
a
good
idea
the
foreman
moved
his
scratching
hand
to
his
lower
ribs
and
scratched
there
quietly
idea
mr
bloom
said
is
the
house
of

innuendo
of

tourists
you

can
you
do
that
i
could
ask
him
perhaps
about
how
to
pronounce
that
voglio
but
then
if
he
didn
t
know
only
make
it
awkward
for
him
better
not
can
do
that
the
foreman
said

a

back
over

that
it
was

trivial
in
itself
that
striking
of
that

that
determined
the

of
both
our

moulding

of
it
that
stony
effigy
in

horned

terrible

divine
that
eternal
symbol
of

of

if
aught
that
the

professor
machugh
said
waving
the
cigarettecase
aside
wait
a
moment
let
me
say
one
thing
the
finest
display
of
oratory
i
ever
heard
was
a
speech
made
by
john
f
taylor
at
the
college
historical
society
mr
justice
fitzgibbon
the
present
lord
justice
of
appeal
had
spoken
and
the
paper
under
debate
was
an
essay
new
for
those
days
advocating
the
revival
of
the
irish
tongue
he
turned
towards
myles
crawford
and
said
know
gerald
fitzgibbon
then
you
can
imagine
the
style
of
his
discourse
is
sitting
with
tim
healy
o
molloy
said
rumour
has
it
on
the
trinity
college
estates
commission
is
sitting
with
a
sweet
thing
myles
crawford
said
in
a
child
s
frock
go
on
well
was
the
speech
mark
you
the
professor
said
of
a
finished
orator
full
of
courteous
haughtiness
and
pouring
in
chastened
diction
i
will
not
say
the
vials
of
his
wrath
but
pouring
the
proud
man
s
contumely
upon
the
new
movement
it
was
then
a
new
movement
we
were
weak
therefore
worthless
he
closed
his
long
thin
lips
an
instant
but
eager
to
be
on
raised
an
outspanned
hand
to
his
spectacles
and
with
trembling
thumb
and
ringfinger
touching
lightly
the
black
rims
steadied
them
to
a
new
focus
impromptu
in
ferial
tone
he
addressed
o
molloy
had
come
there
you
must
know
from
a
sickbed
that
he
had
prepared
his
speech
i
do
not
believe
for
there
was
not
even
one
shorthandwriter
in
the
hall
his
dark
lean
face
had
a
growth
of
shaggy
beard
round
it
he
wore
a
loose
white
silk
neckcloth
and
altogether
he
looked
though
he
was
not
a
dying
man
his
gaze
turned
at
once
but
slowly
from
o
molloy
s
towards
stephen
s
face
and
then
bent
at
once
to
the
ground
seeking
his
unglazed
linen
collar
appeared
behind
his
bent
head
soiled
by
his
withering
hair
still
seeking
he
said
fitzgibbon
s
speech
had
ended
john
f
taylor
rose
to
reply
briefly
as
well
as
i
can
bring
them
to
mind
his
words
were
these
he
raised
his
head
firmly
his
eyes
bethought
themselves
once
more
witless
shellfish
swam
in
the
gross
lenses
to
and
fro
seeking
outlet
he
began
chairman
ladies
and
gentlemen
great
was
my
admiration
in
listening
to
the
remarks
addressed
to
the
youth
of
ireland
a
moment
since
by
my
learned
friend
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
been
transported
into
a
country
far
away
from
this
country
into
an
age
remote
from
this
age
that
i
stood
in
ancient
egypt
and
that
i
was
listening
to
the
speech
of
some
highpriest
of
that
land
addressed
to
the
youthful
moses
his
listeners
held
their
cigarettes
poised
to
hear
their
smokes
ascending
in
frail
stalks
that
flowered
with
his
speech
and
let
our
crooked
smokes
noble
words
coming
look
out
could
you
try
your
hand
at
it
yourself
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
heard
the
voice
of
that
egyptian
highpriest
raised
in
a
tone
of
like
haughtiness
and
like
pride
i
heard
his
words
and
their
meaning
was
revealed
to
me
from
the
fathers
it
was
revealed
to
me
that
those
things
are
good
which
yet
are
corrupted
which
neither
if
they
were
supremely
good
nor
unless
they
were
good
could
be
corrupted
ah
curse
you
that

lifted
his
voice
above
it
boldly

and

had
the
youthful
moses
listened
to
and
accepted
that
view
of
life
had
he
bowed
his

and
bowed
his

and
bowed

that
arrogant
admonition
he
would
never
have
brought
the
chosen
people
out
of
their
house
of

nor
followed
the
pillar
of

by

he
would
never
have
spoken
with
the
eternal
amid
lightnings
on

mountaintop
nor
ever
have
come
down
with
the
light
of

shining
in
his
countenance
and
bearing
in
his
arms
the
tables
of
the

graven
in
the

of

he
ceased
and
looked
at
them
enjoying
a
silence
him
o
molloy
said
not
without
regret
yet
he
died
without
having
entered
the
land
of

lenehan
added
and
with
a
great
future
behind
him
the
troop
of

heard

along

up

he
comes
out
with

how
to
tell
a

too
they

looking
for

he
threw
down
among
them
a
crumpled
paper
ball

not
a

the
ball
bobbed
unheeded
on

of

not
such
damn
fools
also
the

i
threw

cake
out
of
the

picked
it
up
in

wake
fifty
yards
astern
live
by
their

they
wheeled
flapping
the
hungry
famished
gull
flaps
o
er
the

dull
that
is
how

write
the
similar
sounds
but
then

his

passed
over
the
glazed
apples
serried
on

stand
australians

must
be
this
time
of
year
shiny
peels
polishes
them
up
with
a
rag
or
a
handkerchief
wait
those
poor
birds
he
halted
again
and
bought
from
the
old
applewoman
two
banbury
cakes
for
a
penny
and
broke
the
brittle
paste
and
threw
its
fragments
down
into
the
liffey
see
that
the
gulls
swooped
silently
two
then
all
from
their
heights
pouncing
on
prey
gone
every
morsel
aware
of
their
greed
and
cunning
he
shook
the
powdery
crumb
from
his
hands
they
never
expected
that
manna
live
on

fishy
flesh
they
have
all
seabirds
gulls

swans
from

liffey
swim
down

of

not
even
a

disease
too
if

cram
a
turkey

it
tastes
like

then
why
is
it
that
saltwater
fish

not
salty
how
is
that
his

shuffled
out
of

hugging
two

to
his
ribs
blown
in
from

suffered
her
to
overtake
him
without
surprise
and
thrust
his
dull
grey
beard
towards
her
his
loose
jaw
wagging
as
he
spoke
earnestly

a

tapping
the

with
his

no

you

mr

asked
the

did
not

his

frowned
weakly
he
moved
his

uncertainly
re
in

mr

said
molesworth

do
you

there
s
nothing
in
the

the
cane
moved
out
trembling
to
the
left
mr
bloom
s
eye
followed
its
line
and
saw
again
the
dyeworks
van
drawn
up
before
drago
s
where
i
saw
his
brillantined
hair
just
when
i
was
horse
drooping
driver
in
john
long

slaking
his
drouth
s
a

there
mr

said
but
it

not

i

you
across
do
you
want
to
go
to

the
stripling
answered
south
frederick

mr
bloom
said
he
touched
the
thin
elbow
gently
then
took
the
limp
seeing
hand
to
guide
it
forward
say
something
to
him
better
not
do
the
condescending
they
mistrust
what
you
tell

pass
a

remark
rain

his

i

for

have
to

first
like
a

s

his
hand
like
milly
s
was
sensitive
sizing
me
up
i
daresay
from
my
hand
wonder
if
he
has
a
name
van
keep
his

clear
of
the
horse

legs
tired
drudge
get
his

that

sir

i
m
a

now
first
turn
to
the
left
the
blind
stripling
tapped
the
curbstone
and
went
on
his
way
drawing
his
cane
back
feeling
again
mr
bloom
walked
behind
the
eyeless
feet
a
flatcut
suit
of
herringbone
tweed
poor
young
fellow
how
on
earth
did
he
know
that
van
was
there
must
have
felt
it
see
things
in
their
forehead
perhaps
kind
of
sense
of
volume
weight
or
size
of
it
something
blacker
than
the
dark
wonder
would
he
feel
it
if
something
was
removed
feel
a
gap
queer
idea
of
dublin
he
must
have
tapping
his
way
round
by
the
stones
could
he
walk
in
a
beeline
if
he
hadn
t
that
cane
bloodless
pious
face
like
a
fellow
going
in

be
a

that
was
that

look
at

the

they
can
learn
to
do
read
with

tune

or
we
are
surprised
they
have
any
brains
why
we
think
a
deformed
person
or
a
hunchback
clever
if
he
says
something
we
might
say
of

also

in

they
say

no

and
with
a

for

more
shameless
not
seeing
that
girl
passing
the
stewart
institution
head
in
the
air
look
at
me
i
have
them
all
on
must
be
strange
not
to
see
her
kind
of
a
form
in
his
mind
s
eye
the
voice
temperatures
when
he
touches
her
with
his
fingers
must
almost
see
the
lines
the
curves
his
hands
on
her
hair
for
instance
say
it
was
black
for
instance
good
we
call
it
black
then
passing
over
her
white
skin
different

perhaps
feeling
of

postoffice
must
answer

half
a

my
little
present
stationer
s
just
here
too
wait
think
over
it
with
a
gentle
finger
he
felt
ever
so
slowly
the
hair
combed
back
above
his
ears
again
fibres
of
fine
fine
straw
then
gently
his
finger
felt
the
skin
of
his
right
cheek
downy
hair
there
too
not
smooth
enough
the
belly
is
the
smoothest
about
there
he

frederick

perhaps

academy

might
be
settling
my

walking
by
doran

he
slid
his
hand
between
his
waistcoat
and
trousers
and
pulling
aside
his
shirt
gently
felt
a
slack
fold
of
his
belly
but
i
know
it
s
whitey
yellow
want
to
try
in
the
dark
to
see
he
withdrew
his
hand
and
pulled
his
dress
to
poor
fellow
quite
a
boy
terrible
really
terrible
what

would
he

art
has
to

ideas
formless

the
supreme
question
about
a
work
of

is
out
of
how
deep
a

does
it
spring
the
painting
of
gustave

is
the
painting

the

of

the
words
of
hamlet
bring
our

into

all
the

a

with

it

a

and
the

is

who
has
studied

all
the

of
his

which
were
not
vanity
in

to
play
the

your

he

asks
me
why
did
he
come

or
an

there
is
a

stephen
said
there
must
have
been
first
a
sundering
christfox
in

hiding
a
runaway
in
blighted
treeforks
from
hue
and
cry
knowing
no
vixen
walking
lonely
in

women
he
won
to
him
tender
people
a
whore
of
babylon
ladies
of
justices
bully
tapsters
wives
fox
and
geese
and
in
new
place
a
slack
dishonoured
body
that
once
was
comely
once
as
sweet
as
fresh
as
cinnamon
now
her
leaves
falling
all
bare
frighted
of
the
narrow
grave
and
unforgiven
so
you
think
the
door
closed
behind
the
outgoer
rest
suddenly
possessed
the
discreet
vaulted
cell
rest
of
warm
and
brooding
air
a

here
he
ponders
things
that
were
not
what
cæsar
would
have
lived
to
do
had
he
believed
the
soothsayer
what
might
have
been
possibilities
of
the
possible
as
possible
things
not
known
what
name
achilles
bore
when
he
lived
among

coffined
thoughts
around
me
in

embalmed
in

of

thoth

and
i
heard
the
voice
of
that
egyptian
highpriest
in
painted
chambers
loaded
with
tilebooks
they
are
still
once
quick
in
the
brains
of
men
still
but
an
itch
of
death
is
in
them
to
tell
me
in
my
ear
a
maudlin
tale
urge
me
to
wreak
their
will
john
eglinton
mused
of
all
great
men
he
is
the
most
enigmatic
we
know
nothing
but
that
he
lived
and
suffered
not
even
so
much
others
abide
our
question
a
shadow
hangs
over
all
the
rest
hamlet
is
so
personal
isn
t
it
mr
best
pleaded
i
mean
a
kind
of
private
paper
don
t
you
know
of
his
private
life
i
mean
i
don
t
care
a
button
don
t
you
know
who
is
killed
or
who
is
guilty
he
rested
an
innocent
book
on

edge
of
the

eglinton
was
prepared
for
paradoxes
from
what
malachi
mulligan
told
us
but
i
may
as
well
warn
you
that
if
you
want
to
shake
my
belief
that
shakespeare
is
hamlet
you
have
a
stern
task
before
you
bear
with
me
stephen
withstood
the
bane

glinting

under

i
thank
thee
for
the

stephen
said
from
day
to
day
their
molecules
shuttled
to
and
fro
so
does
the
artist
weave
and
unweave
his
image
and
as
the
mole
on
my
right
breast
is
where
it
was
when
i
was
born
though
all
my
body
has
been
woven
of
new
stuff
time
after
time
so
through
the
ghost
of
the
unquiet
father
the
image
of
the
unliving
son
looks
forth
in
the
intense
instant
of
imagination
when
the
mind
shelley
says
is
a
fading
coal
that
which
i
was
is
that
which
i
am
and
that
which
in
possibility
i
may
come
to
be
so
in
the
future
the
sister
of
the
past
i
may
see
myself
as
i
sit
here
now
but
by
reflection
from
that
which
then
i
shall
be
drummond
of

helped
you
at
that
stile
mr
best
said
youngly
i
feel
hamlet
quite
young
the
bitterness
might
be
from
the
father
but
the
passages
with
ophelia
are
surely
from
the
son
has
the
wrong
sow
by
the
lug
he
is
in
my
father
i
am
in
his

is
the
last
to

stephen
said
laughing
john
eglinton
made
a
nothing
pleasing
mow
that
were
the
birthmark
of
genius
he
said
genius
would
be
a
drug
in
the
market
the
plays
of
shakespeare
s
later
years
which
renan
admired
so
much
breathe
another
spirit
spirit
of
reconciliation
the
quaker
librarian
breathed
can
be
no
reconciliation
stephen
said
if
there
has
not
been
a
sundering
said
that
you
want
to
know
what
are
the

which
cast
their
shadow
over
the
hell
of

of
king
lear
othello
hamlet
troilus

with

hope
mr

will
work
out
his

for

we
ought
to
mention
another
irish
commentator
mr
george
bernard
shaw
nor
should
we
forget
mr
frank
harris
his
articles
on

in

were
surely
brilliant
oddly
enough
he
too
draws
for
us
an
unhappy
relation
with
the
dark

of

the
favoured
rival
is
william
herbert
earl

own
that
if

stephen
said
there
s
a
saying
of
goethe
s
which
mr
magee
likes
to
quote
beware
of
what
you
wish
for
in
youth
because
you
will
get
it
in
middle
life
why
does
he
send
to
one
who
is
a
buonaroba
a
bay
where
all
men
ride
a
maid
of
honour
with
a
scandalous
girlhood
a
lordling
to
woo
for
him
he
was
himself
a
lord
of
language
and
had
made
himself
a
coistrel
gentleman
and
he
had
written
romeo
and
juliet
why
belief
in
himself
has
been
untimely
killed
he
was
overborne
in
a
cornfield
first
ryefield
i
should
say
and
he
will
never
be
a
victor
in
his
own
eyes
after
nor
play
victoriously
the
game
of
laugh
and
lie
down
assumed
dongiovannism
will
not
save
him
no
later
undoing
will
undo
the
first
undoing
the
tusk
of
the
boar
has
wounded
him
there
where
love
lies
ableeding
if
the
shrew
is
worsted
yet
there
remains
to
her
woman
s
invisible
weapon
there
is
i
feel
in
the
words
some
goad
of
the
flesh
driving
him
into
a
new
passion
a
darker
shadow
of
the
first
darkening
even
his
own
understanding
of
himself
a
like
fate
awaits
him
and
the
two
rages
commingle
in
a
whirlpool
they
list
and
in
the
porches
of
their
ears
i
pour
soul
has
been
before
stricken
mortally
a
poison
poured
in
the
porch
of
a
sleeping
ear
but
those
who
are
done
to
death
in
sleep
can
not
know
the
manner
of
their
quell
unless
their
creator
endow
their
souls
with
that
knowledge
in
the
life
to
come
the
poisoning
and
the
beast
with

backs
that
urged
it
king
hamlet
s
ghost
could
not
know
of
were
he
not
endowed
with
knowledge
by
his
creator
that
is
why
the
speech
his
lean
unlovely
english
is
always
turned
elsewhere
backward
ravisher
and
ravished
what
he
would

would
not
go
with
him
from

back
weary
of
the
creation
he
has
piled
up
to
hide
him
from
himself
an
old
dog
licking
an
old
sore
but
because
loss
is
his
gain
he
passes
on
towards
eternity
in
undiminished

by
the
wisdom

by

of

i
believe
is
searching
for
some
clues
he
swears
his
highness
not
his
lordship

patrick
most
brilliant
of
all
is
that
story
of
wilde
s
mr
best
said
lifting
his
brilliant
notebook
that
portrait
of
mr
where
he
proves
that
the
sonnets
were
written

mr

easily

it
s
all
paradox
don
t
you
know

and
hews
and
hues
the
colour
but
it
s
so
typical
the
way
he
works
it
out
it
s
the
very
essence
of

he

if
you
deny
that
in
the
fifth
scene
of

he
has
branded
her
with
infamy
tell
me
why
there
is
no
mention
of
her
during
the
thirtyfour
years
between
the
day
she
married
him
and
the
day
she
buried
him
all
those

in

she
had
to

explain
you
then
explain

wherein
he
has
commended
her

he
faced
their
silence
to

thus
eglinton
you

but
that
has
been
explained
i
believe
by
jurists
she
was
entitled
to
her
widow
s
dower
at
common
law
his
legal
knowledge
was
great
our
judges
tell
us
him
satan
fleers
mocker
and
therefore
he
left
out
her
name
from
the
first
draft
but
he
did
not
leave
out
the
presents
for
his
granddaughter
for
his
daughters
for
his
sister
for
his
old
cronies
in
stratford
and
in

and
therefore
when
he

that

motive
don

you

we
find
also
in

just
what
you
say
the
three

shakespeare
in

too
don

you

the

that

the

like
to

he
said
which
brother
you
i
understand
you
to
suggest
there
was
misconduct
with
one
of
the

but
perhaps
i
am
anticipating

i

for
a

on
will
say
those
names
were
already
in
the
chronicles
from
which
he
took
the
stuff
of
his

why
did
he
take
them
rather
than
others

richard

unshielded
by

the

of

why
is
the
underplot
of

in
which
edmund

lifted
out
of

spatchcocked
on

a

john

defended
we
should
not

combine
a

with
an

from
a

by
george
meredith
que
moore
would
say
he
puts
bohemia
on
the
seacoast
and
makes
ulysses
quote
aristotle
stephen
answered
himself
because
the
theme
of
the
false
or
the
usurping
or
the
adulterous
brother
or
all
three
in
one
is
to
shakespeare
what
the
poor
are
not
always
with
him
the
note
of
banishment
banishment
from
the
heart
banishment
from
home
sounds
uninterruptedly
from
the
two
gentlemen
of
verona
onward
till
prospero
breaks
his
staff
buries
it
certain
fathoms
in
the
earth
and
drowns
his
book
it
doubles
itself
in
the
middle
of
his

reflects
itself
in
another
repeats
itself

epitasis

catastrophe
it
repeats
itself
again
when
he
is
near
the
grave
when
his
married
daughter
susan
chip
of
the
old
block
is
accused
of
adultery
but
it
was
the
original
sin
that
darkened
his
understanding
weakened
his
will
and
left
in
him
a
strong
inclination
to
evil
the
words
are
those
of
my
lords
bishops
of
maynooth
an
original
sin
and
like
original
sin
committed
by
another
in
whose
sin
he
too
has
sinned
it
is
between
the
lines
of
his
last
written
words
it
is
petrified
on
his

under
which
her
four

are
not

not
for
long
of
soldiers
and
sailors
whose
legs
had
been
shot
off
by

ending

he

he
walked
by

and
towards
him
came
the
wife
of
mr
david
sheehy
well
indeed
father
and
you
father
father
conmee
was
wonderfully
well
indeed
he
would
go
to
buxton
probably
for
the
waters
and
her
boys
were
they
getting
on
well
at
belvedere
was
that
so
father
conmee
was
very
glad
indeed
to
hear
that
and
mr
sheehy
himself
still
in
london
the
house
was
still
sitting
to
be
sure
it
was
beautiful
weather
it
was
delightful
indeed
yes
it
was
very
probable
that
father
bernard
vaughan
would
come
again
to
preach
o
yes
a
very
great
success
a
wonderful
man
really
father
conmee
was
very
glad
to
see
the
wife
of
mr
david
sheehy
iooking
so
well
and
he
begged
to
be
remembered
to
mr
david
sheehy
yes
he
would
certainly
call
afternoon
mrs
sheehy
father
conmee
doffed
his
silk
hat
and
smiled
as
he
took
leave
at
the
jet
beads
of
her
mantilla
inkshining
in
the
sun
and
smiled
yet
again
in
going
he
had
cleaned
his
teeth
he
knew
with
arecanut
paste
father
conmee
walked
and
walking
smiled
for
he
thought
on
father
bernard
vaughan
s
droll
eyes
and
cockney
voice
wy
don
t
you
old
back
that
owlin
mob
a
zealous
man
however
really
he
was
and
really
did
great
good
in
his
way
beyond
a
doubt
he
loved
ireland
he
said
and
he
loved
the
irish
of
good
family
too
would
one
think
it
welsh
were
they
not
o
lest
he
forget
that
letter
to
father
provincial
father
conmee
stopped
three
little
schoolboys
at
the
corner
of
mountjoy
square
yes
they
were
from
belvedere
the
little
house
aha
and
were
they
good
boys
at
school
o
that
was
very
good
now
and
what
was
his
name
jack
sohan
and
his
name
ger
gallaher
and
the
other
little
man
his
name
was
brunny
lynam
o
that
was
a
very
nice
name
to
have
father
conmee
gave
a
letter
from
his
breast
to
master
brunny
lynam
and
pointed
to
the
red
pillarbox
at
the
corner
of
fitzgibbon
street
mind
you
don
t
post
yourself
into
the
box
little
man
he
said
the
boys
sixeyed
father
conmee
and
laughed
sir
let
me
see
if
you
can
post
a
letter
father
conmee
said
master
brunny
lynam
ran
across
the
road
and
put
father
conmee
s
letter
to
father
provincial
into
the
mouth
of
the
bright
red
letterbox
father
conmee
smiled
and
nodded
and
smiled
and
walked
along

respectfully
took
the

as
he
passed

at
the
corner
of
dignam

was
that
not
mrs
m
guinness
mrs
m
guinness
stately
silverhaired
bowed
to
father
conmee
from
the
farther
footpath
along
which
she
sailed
and
father
conmee
smiled
and
saluted
how
did
she
do
a
fine
carriage
she
had
like
mary
queen
of
scots
something
and
to
think
that
she
was
a
pawnbroker
well
now
such
a
what
should
he
say
such
a
queenly
mien
father
conmee
walked
down
great
charles
street
and
glanced
at
the
shutup
free
church
on
his
left
the
reverend
greene
will
speak
the
incumbent
they
called
him
he
felt
it
incumbent
on
him
to
say
a
few
words
but
one
should
be
charitable
invincible
ignorance
they
acted
according
to
their
lights
father
conmee
turned
the
corner
and
walked
along
the
north
circular
road
it
was
a
wonder
that
there
was
not
a
tramline
in
such
an
important
thoroughfare
surely
there
ought
to
be
a
band
of
satchelled
schoolboys
crossed
from
richmond
street
all
raised
untidy
caps
father
conmee
greeted
them
more
than
once
benignly
christian
brother
boys
father
conmee
smelt
incense
on
his
right
hand
as
he
walked
saint
joseph
s
church
portland
row
for
aged
and
virtuous
females
father
conmee
raised
his
hat
to
the
blessed
sacrament
virtuous
but
occasionally
they
were
also
badtempered
near
aldborough
house
father
conmee
thought
of
that
spendthrift
nobleman
and
now
it
was
an
office
or
something
father
conmee
began
to
walk
along
the
north
strand
road
and
was
saluted
by
mr
william
gallagher
who
stood
in
the
doorway
of
his
shop
father
conmee
saluted
mr
william
gallagher
and
perceived
the
odours
that
came
from
baconflitches
and
ample
cools
of
butter
he
passed
grogan
s
the
tobacconist
against
which
newsboards
leaned
and
told
of
a
dreadful
catastrophe
in
new
york
in
america
those
things
were
continually
happening
unfortunate
people
to
die
like
that
unprepared
still
an
act
of
perfect
contrition
father
conmee
went
by
daniel
bergin
s
publichouse
against
the
window
of
which
two
unlabouring
men
lounged
they
saluted
him
and
were
saluted
father
conmee
passed
o
neill
s
funeral
establishment
where
corny
kelleher
totted
figures
in
the
daybook
while
he
chewed
a
blade
of
hay
a
constable
on
his
beat
saluted
father
conmee
and
father
conmee
saluted
the
constable
in
youkstetter
s
the
porkbutcher
s
father
conmee
observed
pig
s
puddings
white
and
black
and
red
lie
neatly
curled
in
tubes
moored
under
the
trees
of
charleville
mall
father
conmee
saw
a
turfbarge
a
towhorse
with
pendent
head
a
bargeman
with
a
hat
of
dirty
straw
seated
amidships
smoking
and
staring
at
a
branch
of
poplar
above
him
it
was
idyllic
and
father
conmee
reflected
on
the
providence
of
the
creator
who
had
made
turf
to
be
in
bogs
whence
men
might
dig
it
out
and
bring
it
to
town
and
hamlet
to
make
fires
in
the
houses
of
poor
people
on
newcomen
bridge
the
very
reverend
john
conmee
of
saint
francis
xavier
s
church
upper
gardiner
street
stepped
on
to
an
outward
bound
tram
off
an
inward
bound
tram
stepped
the
reverend
nicholas
dudley
of
saint
agatha
s
church
north
william
street
on
to
newcomen
bridge
at
newcomen
bridge
father
conmee
stepped
into
an
outward
bound
tram
for
he
disliked
to
traverse
on
foot
the
dingy
way
past
mud
island
father
conmee
sat
in
a
corner
of
the
tramcar
a
blue
ticket
tucked
with
care
in
the
eye
of
one
plump
kid
glove
while
four
shillings
a
sixpence
and
five
pennies
chuted
from
his
other
plump
glovepalm
into
his
purse
passing
the
ivy
church
he
reflected
that
the
ticket
inspector
usually
made
his
visit
when
one
had
carelessly
thrown
away
the
ticket
the
solemnity
of
the
occupants
of
the
car
seemed
to
father
conmee
excessive
for
a
journey
so
short
and
cheap
father
conmee
liked
cheerful
decorum
it
was
a
peaceful
day
the
gentleman
with
the
glasses
opposite
father
conmee
had
finished
explaining
and
looked
down
his
wife
father
conmee
supposed
a
tiny
yawn
opened
the
mouth
of
the
wife
of
the
gentleman
with
the
glasses
she
raised
her
small
gloved
fist
yawned
ever
so
gently
tiptapping
her
small
gloved
fist
on
her
opening
mouth
and
smiled
tinily
sweetly
father
conmee
perceived
her
perfume
in
the
car
he
perceived
also
that
the
awkward
man
at
the
other
side
of
her
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
seat
father
conmee
at
the
altarrails
placed
the
host
with
difficulty
in
the
mouth
of
the
awkward
old
man
who
had
the
shaky
head
at
annesley
bridge
the
tram
halted
and
when
it
was
about
to
go
an
old
woman
rose
suddenly
from
her
place
to
alight
the
conductor
pulled
the
bellstrap
to
stay
the
car
for
her
she
passed
out
with
her
basket
and
a
marketnet
and
father
conmee
saw
the
conductor
help
her
and
net
and
basket
down
and
father
conmee
thought
that
as
she
had
nearly
passed
the
end
of
the
penny
fare
she
was
one
of
those
good
souls
who
had
always
to
be
told
twice
bless
you
my
child
that
they
have
been
absolved
pray
for
me
but
they
had
so
many
worries
in
life
so
many
cares
poor
creatures
from
the
hoardings
mr
eugene
stratton
grimaced
with
thick
niggerlips
at
father
conmee
father
conmee
thought
of
the
souls
of
black
and
brown
and
yellow
men
and
of
his
sermon
on
saint
peter
claver
and
the
african
mission
and
of
the
propagation
of
the
faith
and
of
the
millions
of
black
and
brown
and
yellow
souls
that
had
not
received
the
baptism
of
water
when
their
last
hour
came
like
a
thief
in
the
night
that
book
by
the
belgian
jesuit
le
nombre
des
élus
seemed
to
father
conmee
a
reasonable
plea
those
were
millions
of
human
souls
created
by
god
in
his
own
likeness
to
whom
the
faith
had
not
been

whispered
behind

to
haines
s

there
in

they
chose
a
small
table
near
the
window
opposite
a
longfaced
man
whose
beard
and
gaze
hung
intently
down
on
a
chessboard
that
he
haines
asked
twisting
round
in

mulligan
said
that
s
john
howard
his

our
city
marshal
john
howard
parnell
translated
a
white
bishop
quietly
and
his
grey
claw
went
up
again
to
his
forehead
whereat
it
rested
an
instant
after
under
its
screen
his
eyes
looked
quickly
ghostbright
at
his
foe
and
fell
once
more
upon
a
working
corner
ll
take
a
mélange
haines
said
to
the

buck
mulligan
said
and
bring
us
some
scones
and
butter
and
some

as
well
when

bad
cakes

but
you
missed

haines
opened
his

m
sorry
he
said

the

huntingground
of
all

that
have
lost
their

the

sailor
growled
at

shook
gaily
to

i
call

sure
he

an

haines
said
pinching
his
chin
thoughtfully
with
thumb
and
forefinger
now
i
am
speculating
what
it
would
be
likely
to
be
such
persons
always
have
buck
mulligan
bent
across
the
table
gravely
drove
his
wits
astray
he
said
by
visions
of
hell
he
will
never
capture
the
attic
note
the
note
of
swinburne
of
all
poets
the
white
death
and
the
ruddy
birth
that
is
his
tragedy
he
can
never
be

joy
of
creation
punishment
haines
said
nodding
curtly
i
see
i
tackled
him
this
morning
on
belief
there
was
something
on
his
mind
i
saw
it
s
rather
interesting
because
professor
pokorny
of
vienna
makes
an
interesting
point
out
of
that
buck
mulligan
s
watchful
eyes
saw
the
waitress
come
he
helped
her
to
unload
her
tray
can
find
no
trace
of
hell
in
ancient
irish
myth
haines
said
amid
the
cheerful
cups
the
moral
idea
seems
lacking
the
sense
of
destiny
of
retribution
rather
strange
he
should
have
just
that
fixed
idea
does
he
write
anything
for
your
movement
he
sank
two
lumps
of
sugar
deftly
longwise
through
the
whipped
cream
buck
mulligan
slit
a
steaming
scone
in
two
and
plastered
butter
over
its
smoking
pith
he
bit
off
a
soft
piece
hungrily
years
he
said
chewing
and
laughing
he
is
going
to
write
something
in
ten
years
a
long
way
off
haines
said
thoughtfully
lifting
his
spoon
still
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
he
did
after
all
he
tasted
a
spoonful
from
the
creamy
cone
of
his

part
of

man
in

about

rory

joe

occasion

rise
says
he
sliding
his
hand
down
his
fork
so
begob
the
citizen
claps
his
paw
on
his
knee
and
he
says
wars

the
cause
of
it
and
says
joe
sticking
his
thumb
in
his
pocket
s
the
russians
wish
to
tyrannise
give
over
your
bloody
codding
joe
says
i

citizen
says
he
better

chara
says
he
what
garry
are
we
going
to
win
eh
and
with
that
he
took
the
bloody
old
towser
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
by
jesus
he
near
throttled
him
the
figure
seated
on
a
large
boulder
at
the
foot
of
a
round
tower
was
that
of
a
broadshouldered
deepchested

shaggybearded
widemouthed
largenosed
longheaded
deepvoiced
barekneed
brawnyhanded
hairylegged
ruddyfaced
sinewyarmed
hero
from
shoulder
to
shoulder
he
measured
several
ells
and
his
rocklike
mountainous
knees
were
covered
as
was
likewise
the
rest
of
his
body
wherever
visible
with
a
strong
growth
of
tawny
prickly
hair
in
hue
and
toughness
similar
to
the
mountain
gorse
ulex
europeus
the
widewinged
nostrils
from
which
bristles
of
the
same
tawny
hue
projected
were
of
such
capaciousness
that
within
their
cavernous
obscurity
the
fieldlark
might
easily
have
lodged
her
nest
the
eyes
in
which
a
tear
and
a
smile
strove
ever
for
the
mastery
were
of
the
dimensions
of
a
goodsized
cauliflower
a
powerful
current
of
warm
breath
issued
at
regular
intervals
from
the
profound
cavity
of
his
mouth
while
in
rhythmic
resonance
the
loud
strong
hale
reverberations
of
his
formidable
heart
thundered
rumblingly
causing
the
ground
the
summit
of
the
lofty
tower
and
the
still
loftier
walls
of
the
cave
to
vibrate
and
tremble
he
wore
a
long
unsleeved
garment
of
recently
flayed
oxhide
reaching
to
the
knees
in
a
loose
kilt
and
this
was
bound
about
his
middle
by
a
girdle
of
plaited
straw
and
rushes
beneath
this
he
wore
trews
of
deerskin
roughly
stitched
with
gut
his
nether
extremities
were
encased
in
high
balbriggan
buskins
dyed
in
lichen
purple
the
feet
being
shod
with
brogues
of
salted
cowhide
laced
with
the
windpipe
of
the
same
beast
from
his
girdle
hung
a
row
of
seastones
which
jangled
at
every
movement
of
his
portentous
frame
and
on
these
were
graven
with
rude
yet
striking
art
the
tribal
images
of

full
of
the
foamy
ebon
ale
which
the
noble
twin
brothers
bungiveagh
and
bungardilaun
brew
ever
in
their
divine
alevats
cunning
as
the
sons
of
deathless
leda
for
they
garner
the
succulent
berries
of
the
hop
and
mass
and
sift
and
bruise
and
brew
them
and
they
mix
therewith
sour
juices
and
bring
the
must
to
the
sacred
fire
and
cease
not
night
or
day
from
their
toil
those
cunning

lords
of

you
chivalrous
terence

manner
born

nectarous
beverage
and
you
offered
the
crystal
cup
to
him
that
thirsted
the
soul
of
chivalry
in
beauty
akin
to
the
immortals
but
he
the
young
chief
of
the
o
bergan
s
could
ill
brook
to
be
outdone
in
generous
deeds
but
gave
therefor
with
gracious
gesture
a
testoon
of
costliest
bronze
thereon
embossed
in
excellent
smithwork

seen
the
image
of

says
joe
they

the
liberty
of
burying

this
morning
anyhow
says
alf
says
joe
he
paid
the
debt
of
nature
god
be
merciful
to
him
christ
says
alf
begob
he
was
what
you
might
call
flabbergasted
in
the
darkness
spirit
hands
were
felt
to
flutter
and
when
prayer
by
tantras
had
been
directed
to
the
proper
quarter
a
faint
but
increasing
luminosity
of
ruby
light
became
gradually
visible
the
apparition
of
the
etheric
double
being
particularly
lifelike
owing
to
the
discharge
of
jivic
rays
from
the
crown
of
the
head
and
face
communication
was
effected
through
the
pituitary
body
and
also
by
means
of
the
orangefiery
and
scarlet
rays
emanating
from
the
sacral
region
and
solar
plexus
questioned
by
his
earthname
as
to
his
whereabouts
in
the
heavenworld
he
stated
that
he
was
now
on
the
path
of
pralaya
or
return
but
was
still
submitted
to
trial
at
the
hands
of
certain
bloodthirsty
entities
on
the
lower
astral
levels
in
reply
to
a
question
as
to
his
first
sensations
in
the
great
divide
beyond
he
stated
that
previously
he
had
seen
as
in
a
glass
darkly
but
that
those
who
had
passed
over
had
summit
possibilities
of
atmic
development
opened
up
to
them
interrogated
as
to
whether
life
there
resembled
our
experience
in
the
flesh
he
stated
that
he
had
heard
from
more
favoured
beings
now
in
the
spirit
that
their
abodes
were
equipped
with
every
modern
home
comfort
such
as
talafana
alavatar
hatakalda
wataklasat
and
that
the
highest
adepts
were
steeped
in
waves
of
volupcy
of
the
very
purest
nature
having
requested
a
quart
of
buttermilk
this
was
brought
and
evidently
afforded
relief
asked
if
he
had
any
message
for
the
living
he
exhorted
all
who
were
still
at
the
wrong
side
of
maya
to
acknowledge
the
true
path
for
it
was
reported
in
devanic
circles
that
mars
and
jupiter
were
out
for
mischief
on
the
eastern
angle
where
the
ram
has
power
it
was
then
queried
whether
there
were
any
special
desires
on
the
part
of
the
defunct
and
the
reply
was
we
greet
you
friends
of
earth
who
are
still
in
the
body
mind
doesn
t
pile
it
on
it
was
ascertained
that
the
reference
was
to
mr
cornelius
kelleher
manager
of
messrs
o
neill
s
popular
funeral
establishment
a
personal
friend
of
the
defunct
who
had
been
responsible
for
the
carrying
out
of
the
interment
arrangements
before
departing
he
requested
that
it
should
be
told
to
his
dear
son
patsy
that
the
other
boot
which
he
had
been
looking
for
was
at
present
under
the
commode
in
the
return
room
and
that
the
pair
should
be
sent
to
cullen
s
to
be
soled
only
as
the
heels
were
still
good
he
stated
that
this
had
greatly
perturbed
his
peace
of
mind
in
the
other
region
and
earnestly
requested
that
his
desire
should
be
made
known
assurances
were
given
that
the
matter
would
be
attended
to
and
it
was
intimated
that
this
had
given
satisfaction
he
is
gone
from
mortal
haunts

out
of
my

alf
hello
bloom
says
he
what

so
they
started
arguing
about
the
point
bloom
saying
he
wouldn
t
and
he
couldn
t
and
excuse
him
no
offence
and
all
to
that
and
then
he
said
well
he

a
cigar
gob
he
s
a
prudent
member
and
no
mistake
us
one
of
your
prime

terry
says
joe
and
alf
was
telling
us
there
was
one
chap
sent
in
a
mourning
card
with
a
black
border
round
it
re
all
barbers
says
he
from
the
black
country
that
would
hang
their
own
fathers
for
five
quid
down
and
travelling
expenses
and
he
was
telling
us
there
s
two
fellows
waiting
below
to
pull
his
heels
down
when
he
gets
the
drop
and
choke
him
properly
and
then
they
chop
up
the
rope
after
and
sell
the
bits
for
a
few
bob
a
skull
in
the
dark
land
they
bide
the
vengeful
knights
of
the
razor
their
deadly
coil
they
grasp
yea
and
therein
they
lead
to
erebus
whatsoever
wight
hath
done
a
deed
of
blood
for
i
will
on
nowise
suffer
it
even
so
saith
the
lord
so
they
started
talking
about
capital
punishment
and
of
course
bloom
comes
out
with
the
why
and
the
wherefore
and
all
the
codology
of
the
business
and
the
old
dog
smelling
him
all
the
time
i
m
told
those
jewies
does
have
a
sort
of
a
queer
odour
coming
off
them
for
dogs
about
i
don
t
know
what
all
deterrent
effect
and
so
forth
and
so
on
s
one
thing
it
hasn
t
a
deterrent
effect
on
says
alf
s
that
says
joe
poor
bugger
s
tool
that
s
being
hanged
says
alf
so
says
joe
s
truth
says
alf
i
heard
that
from
the
head
warder
that
was
in
kilmainham
when
they
hanged
joe
brady
the
invincible
he
told
me
when
they
cut
him
down
after
the
drop
it
was
standing
up
in
their
faces
like
a
poker
passion
strong
in
death
says
joe
as
someone
said
can
be
explained
by
science
says
bloom
it
s
only
a
natural
phenomenon
don
t
you
see
because
on
account
of
the
and
then
he
starts
with
his
jawbreakers
about
phenomenon
and
science
and
this
phenomenon
and
the
other
phenomenon
the
distinguished
scientist
herr
professor
luitpold
blumenduft
tendered
medical
evidence
to
the
effect
that
the
instantaneous
fracture
of
the
cervical
vertebrae
and
consequent
scission
of
the
spinal
cord
would
according
to
the
best
approved
tradition
of
medical
science
be
calculated
to
inevitably
produce
in
the
human
subject
a
violent
ganglionic
stimulus
of
the
nerve
centres
of
the
genital
apparatus
thereby
causing
the
elastic
pores
of
the
corpora
cavernosa
to
rapidly
dilate
in
such
a
way
as
to
instantaneously
facilitate
the
flow
of
blood
to
that
part
of
the
human
anatomy
known
as
the
penis
or
male
organ
resulting
in
the
phenomenon
which
has
been
denominated
by
the
faculty
a
morbid
upwards
and
outwards
philoprogenitive
erection
in
articulo
mortis
per
diminutionem
capitis
so
of
course
the
citizen
was
only
waiting
for
the
wink
of
the
word
and
he
starts
gassing
out
of
him
about
the
invincibles
and
the
old
guard
and
the
men
of
sixtyseven
and
who
fears
to
speak
of
ninetyeight
and
joe
with
him
about
all
the
fellows
that
were
hanged
drawn
and
transported
for
the
cause
by
drumhead
courtmartial
and
a
new
ireland
and
new
this
that
and
the
other
talking
about
new
ireland
he
ought
to
go
and
get
a
new
dog
so
he
ought
mangy
ravenous
brute
sniffing
and
sneezing
all
round
the
place
and
scratching
his
scabs
and
round
he
goes
to
bob
doran
that
was
standing
alf
a
half
one
sucking
up
for
what
he
could
get
so
of
course
bob
doran
starts
doing
the
bloody
fool
with
him
us
the
paw
give
the
paw
doggy
good
old
doggy
give
the

he
d

and
alf
trying
to
keep
him
from
tumbling
off
the
bloody
stool
atop
of
the
bloody
old
dog
and
he
talking
all
kinds
of
drivel
about
training
by
kindness
and
thoroughbred
dog
and
intelligent
dog
give
you
the
bloody
pip
then
he
starts
scraping
a
few
bits
of
old
biscuit
out
of
the
bottom
of
a
jacobs
tin
he
told
terry
to
bring
gob
he
golloped
it
down
like
old
boots
and
his
tongue
hanging
out
of
him
a
yard
long

putting

swank
with
his
lardy
face
phenomenon
the
fat
heap
he
married

a
nice
old
phenomenon
with
a
back
on

like
a
ballalley
time
they
were
stopping
up
in
the
city
arms
pisser
burke
told

a
cracked
loodheramaun
of
a

and
bloom
trying
to
get
the
soft
side
of
her
doing
the
mollycoddle
playing
bézique
to
come
in
for
a
bit
of
the
wampum
in
her
will
and
not
eating

friday
because
the
old
one
was
always
thumping
her
craw
and
taking
the
lout
out
for
a
walk
and
one
time
he
led
him
the
rounds
of
dublin
and
by
the
holy
farmer
he
never
cried
crack
till
he
brought
him
home
as
drunk
as
a
boiled
owl
and
he
said
he
did
it
to
teach
him
the
evils
of
alcohol
and
by
herrings
if
the
three
women
didn
t
near
roast
him
it

a
queer
story
the

jesus
i
had
to
laugh
at

the

from

unceasingly

around

by

pieces

the
deafening

lit
up
the
ghastly

testified
that
the
artillery

had
lent
its
supernatural
pomp
to
the

down

without

expressed
themselves
in

possible

terms
concerning
the

barbarity

by

that

abstracted

he
announced
his

painstaking

withal
so
characteristic

with
two
circular
perforated
apertures
through
which
his
eyes
glowered
furiously
as
he
awaited
the
fatal
signal
he
tested
the
edge
of
his
horrible
weapon
by
honing
it
upon
his
brawny
forearm

decapitated

was
in
capital
spirits
when
prepared
for
death
and
evinced
the
keenest
interest
in
the
proceedings
from
beginning
to
end
but
he
with
an
abnegation
rare
in
these
our
times
rose
nobly
to
the
occasion
and
expressed
the
dying
wish
immediately
acceded
to
that
the
meal
should
be
divided
in
aliquot
parts
among
the
members
of

indigent

association
as
a
token
of
his
regard
and
esteem
the
nec
and
non

ultra
of
emotion
were
reached
when
the
blushing
bride
elect
burst
her
way
through
the
serried
ranks
of
the
bystanders
and
flung
herself
upon
the
muscular
bosom
of
him
who
was
about
to
be
launched
into
eternity
for
her
sake
the
hero
folded
her
willowy
form
in
a
loving
embrace
murmuring
fondly
sheila
my
own
encouraged
by
this
use
of
her
christian
name
she
kissed
passionately
all
the
various
suitable
areas
of
his
person
which
the
decencies
of
prison
garb
permitted
her
ardour
to
reach
she
swore
to
him
as
they
mingled
the
salt
streams
of
their
tears
that
she
would
ever
cherish
his
memory
that
she
would
never
forget
her
hero
boy
who
went
to
his
death
with
a
song
on
his
lips
as
if
he
were
but
going
to
a
hurling
match
in
clonturk
park
she
brought
back
to
his
recollection
the
happy
days
of
blissful
childhood
together
on
the
banks
of
anna
liffey
when
they
had
indulged
in
the
innocent
pastimes
of
the
young
and
oblivious
of
the
dreadful
present
they
both
laughed
heartily
all
the
spectators
including
the
venerable
pastor
joining
in
the
general
merriment
that
monster
audience
simply
rocked
with
delight
but
anon
they
were
overcome
with
grief
and
clasped
their
hands
for
the
last
time
a
fresh
torrent
of
tears
burst
from
their
lachrymal
ducts
and
the
vast
concourse
of
people
touched
to
the
inmost
core
broke
into
heartrending
sobs
not
the
least
affected
being
the
aged
prebendary
himself
big
strong
men
officers
of
the
peace
and
genial
giants
of
the
royal
irish
constabulary
were
making
frank
use
of
their
handkerchiefs
and
it
is
safe
to
say
that
there
was
not
a
dry
eye
in
that
record
assemblage
a
most
romantic
incident
occurred
when
a
handsome
young
oxford
graduate
noted
for
his
chivalry
towards
the
fair
sex
stepped
forward
and
presenting
his
visiting
card
bankbook
and
genealogical
tree
solicited
the
hand
of
the
hapless
young
lady
requesting
her
to
name
the
day
and
was
accepted
on
the
spot
every
lady
in
the
audience
was
presented
with
a
tasteful
souvenir
of
the
occasion
in
the
shape
of
a
skull
and
crossbones
brooch
a
timely
and
generous
act
which
evoked
a
fresh
outburst
of
emotion
and
when
the
gallant
young
oxonian
the
bearer
by
the
way
of
one
of
the
most
timehonoured
names
in
albion
s
history
placed
on
the
finger
of
his
blushing
fiancée
an
expensive
engagement
ring
with
emeralds
set
in
the
form
of
a
fourleaved
shamrock
the
excitement
knew
no
bounds
nay
even
the
stern
provostmarshal
lieutenantcolonel
ffrenchmullan
tomlinson
who
presided
on
the
sad
occasion
he
who
had
blown
a
considerable
number
of
sepoys
from
the
cannonmouth
without
flinching
could
not
now
restrain
his
natural
emotion
with
his
mailed
gauntlet
he
brushed
away
a
furtive
tear
and
was
overheard
by
those
privileged
burghers
who
happened
to
be
in
his
immediate
entourage
to
murmur
to
himself
in
a
faltering
undertone
blimey
if
she
aint
a
clinker
that
there
bleeding
tart
blimey
it
makes
me
kind
of
bleeding
cry
straight
it
does
when
i
sees
her
cause
i
thinks
of
my
old
mashtub
what
s
waiting
for
me
down
limehouse
way
so
then
the
citizen
begins
talking
about
the
irish
language
and
the
corporation
meeting
and
all
to
that
and
the
shoneens
that
can
t
speak
their
own
language
and
joe
chipping
in
because
he
stuck
someone
for
a
quid
and
bloom
putting
in
his
old
goo
with
his
twopenny
stump
that
he
cadged
off
of
joe
and
talking
about
the
gaelic
league
and
the
antitreating
league
and
drink
the
curse
of
ireland
antitreating
is
about
the
size
of
it
gob
he
d
let
you
pour
all
manner
of
drink
down
his
throat
till
the
lord
would
call
him
before
you
d
ever
see
the
froth
of
his
pint
and
one
night
i
went
in
with
a
fellow
into
one
of
their
musical
evenings
song
and
dance
about
she
could
get
up
on
a
truss
of
hay
she
could
my
maureen
lay
and
there
was
a
fellow
with
a
ballyhooly
blue
ribbon
badge
spiffing
out
of
him
in
irish
and
a
lot
of
colleen
bawns
going
about
with
temperance
beverages
and
selling
medals
and
oranges
and
lemonade
and
a
few
old
dry
buns
gob
flahoolagh
entertainment
don
t
be
talking
ireland
sober
is
ireland
free
and
then
an
old
fellow
starts
blowing
into
his
bagpipes
and
all
the
gougers
shuffling
their
feet
to
the
tune
the
old
cow
died
of
and
one
or
two
sky
pilots
having
an
eye
around
that
there
was
no
goings
on
with
the
females
hitting
below
the
belt
so
howandever
as
i
was
saying
the
old
dog
seeing
the
tin
was
empty
starts
mousing
around
by
joe
and
me
i
d
train
him
by
kindness
so
i
would
if
he
was
my
dog
give
him
a
rousing
fine
kick
now
and
again
where
it
wouldn
t
blind
him
he
ll
bite
you
says
the
citizen
jeering
says
i
but
he
might
take
my
leg
for
a
lamppost
so
he
calls
the
old
dog
over
s
on
you
garry
says
he
then
he
starts
hauling
and
mauling
and
talking
to
him
in
irish
and
the
old
towser
growling
letting
on
to
answer
like
a
duet
in
the
opera
such
growling
you
never
heard
as
they
let
off
between
them
someone
that
has
nothing
better
to
do
ought
to
write
a
letter
pro
bono
publico
to
the
papers
about
the
muzzling
order
for
a
dog
the
like
of
that
growling
and
grousing
and
his
eye
all
bloodshot
from
the
drouth
is
in
it
and
the
hydrophobia
dropping
out
of
his
jaws
all
those
who
are
interested
in
the
spread
of
human
culture
among
the
lower
animals
and
their
name
is
legion
should
make
a
point
of
not
missing
the
really
marvellous
exhibition
of
cynanthropy
given
by
the
famous
old
irish
red
setter
wolfdog
formerly
known
by
the
sobriquet
of
garryowen
and
recently
rechristened
by
his
large
circle
of
friends
and
acquaintances
owen
garry
the
exhibition
which
is
the
result
of
years
of
training
by
kindness
and
a
carefully
thoughtout
dietary
system
comprises
among
other
achievements
the
recitation
of
verse
our
greatest
living
phonetic
expert
wild
horses
shall
not
drag
it
from
us
has
left
no
stone
unturned
in
his
efforts
to
delucidate
and
compare
the
verse
recited
and
has
found
it
bears
a
striking
resemblance
the
italics
are
ours
to
the
ranns
of
ancient
celtic
bards
we
are
not
speaking
so
much
of
those
delightful
lovesongs
with
which
the
writer
who
conceals
his
identity
under
the
graceful
pseudonym
of
the
little
sweet
branch
has
familiarised
the
bookloving
world
but
rather
as
a
contributor
points
out
in
an
interesting
communication
published
by
an
evening
contemporary
of
the
harsher
and
more
personal
note
which
is
found
in
the
satirical
effusions
of
the
famous
raftery
and
of
donal
macconsidine
to
say
nothing
of
a
more
modern
lyrist
at
present
very
much
in
the
public
eye
we
subjoin
a
specimen
which
has
been
rendered
into
english
by
an
eminent
scholar
whose
name
for
the
moment
we
are
not
at
liberty
to
disclose
though
we
believe
that
our
readers
will
find
the
topical
allusion
rather
more
than
an
indication
the
metrical
system
of
the
canine
original
which
recalls
the
intricate
alliterative
and
isosyllabic
rules
of
the
welsh
englyn
is
infinitely
more
complicated
but
we
believe
our
readers
will
agree
that
the
spirit
has
been
well
caught
perhaps
it
should
be
added
that
the
effect
is
greatly
increased
if
owen
s
verse
be
spoken
somewhat
slowly
and
indistinctly
in
a
tone
suggestive
of
suppressed
rancour
the
curse
of
my
curses
seven

every

he
told
terry
to
bring
some
water
for
the

and
gob
you
could
hear
him
lapping
it
up
a
mile
off
and
joe
asked
him
would
he
have
another

says
he
a
chara
to
show
there

no
ill
feeling

he

not

he
dignam
i
mean
didn
t
serve
any
notice
of

says
joe
laughing
that

a
good
one
if

that
s
a
point
says
bloom
for
the
wife
s
admirers
admirers
says
joe
wife
s
advisers
i
mean
says
bloom
then
he
starts
all
confused
mucking
it
up
about
mortgagor
under
the
act
like
the
lord
chancellor
giving
it
out
on
the
bench
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
wife
and
that
a
trust
is
created
but
on
the
other
hand
that
dignam
owed
bridgeman
the
money
and
if
now
the
wife
or
the
widow
contested
the
mortgagee
s
right
till
he
near
had
the
head
of
me
addled
with
his
mortgagor
under
the
act
he
was
bloody
safe
he
wasn
t
run
in
himself
under
the
act
that
time
as
a
rogue
and
vagabond
only
he
had
a
friend
in
court
selling
bazaar
tickets
or
what
do
you
call
it
royal
hungarian
privileged
lottery
true
as
you
re
there
o
commend
me
to
an
israelite
royal
and
privileged
hungarian
robbery
so
bob
doran
comes
lurching
around
asking
bloom
to
tell
mrs
dignam
he
was
sorry
for
her
trouble
and
he
was
very
sorry
about
the
funeral
and
to
tell
her
that
he
said
and
everyone
who
knew
him
said
that
there
was
never
a
truer
a
finer
than
poor
little
willy
that
s
dead
to
tell
her
choking
with
bloody
foolery
and
shaking
bloom
s
hand
doing
the
tragic
to
tell
her
that
shake
hands
brother
you
re
a
rogue
and
i
m
another
me
said
he
so
far
presume
upon
our
acquaintance
which
however
slight
it
may
appear
if
judged
by
the
standard
of
mere
time
is
founded
as
i
hope
and
believe
on
a
sentiment
of
mutual
esteem
as
to
request
of
you
this
favour
but
should
i
have
overstepped
the
limits
of
reserve
let
the
sincerity
of
my
feelings
be
the
excuse
for
my
boldness
rejoined
the
other
i
appreciate
to
the
full
the
motives
which
actuate
your
conduct
and
i
shall
discharge
the
office
you
entrust
to
me
consoled
by
the
reflection
that
though
the
errand
be
one
of
sorrow
this
proof
of
your
confidence
sweetens
in
some
measure
the
bitterness
of
the
cup
suffer
me
to
take
your
hand
said
he
the
goodness
of
your
heart
i
feel
sure
will
dictate
to
you
better
than
my
inadequate
words
the
expressions
which
are
most
suitable
to
convey
an
emotion
whose
poignancy
were
i
to
give
vent
to
my
feelings
would
deprive
me
even
of
speech
and
off
with
him
and
out
trying
to
walk
straight
boosed
at
five
o
clock
night

mr

like
of

tennis
and
about
hurley
and
putting
the
stone
and
racy
of
the
soil
and
building
up
a
nation
once
again
and
all
to
that
and
of
course

to
have
his
say
too
about
if
a
fellow
had
a
rower

heart
violent
exercise
was
bad
i
declare
to
my
antimacassar
if

that
straw
that
s
a
straw
declare
to
my
aunt
he
d
talk
about
it
for
an
hour
so
he
would
and
talk
steady
a
most
interesting
discussion
took
place
in
the
ancient
hall
of
brian
o
ciarnain
s
in
sraid
na
bretaine
bheag
under
the
auspices
of
sluagh
na
on
the
revival
of
ancient
gaelic
sports
and
the
importance
of
physical
culture
as
understood
in
ancient
greece
and
ancient
rome
and
ancient
ireland
for
the
development
of
the
race
the
venerable
president
of
the
noble
order
was
in
the
chair
and
the
attendance
was
of
large
dimensions
after
an
instructive
discourse
by
the
chairman
a
magnificent
oration
eloquently
and
forcibly
expressed
a
most
interesting
and
instructive
discussion
of
the
usual
high
standard
of
excellence
ensued
as
to
the
desirability
of
the
revivability
of
the
ancient
games
and
sports
of
our
ancient
panceltic
forefathers
the
wellknown
and
highly
respected
worker
in
the
cause
of
our
old
tongue
mr
joseph
m
carthy
hynes
made
an
eloquent
appeal
for
the
resuscitation
of
the
ancient
gaelic
sports
and
pastimes
practised
morning
and
evening
by
finn
maccool
as
calculated
to
revive
the
best
traditions
of
manly
strength
and
prowess
handed
down
to
us
from
ancient
ages
bloom
who
met
with
a
mixed
reception
of
applause
and
hisses
having
espoused
the
negative
the
vocalist
chairman
brought
the
discussion
to
a
close
in
response
to
repeated
requests
and
hearty
plaudits
from
all
parts
of
a
bumper
house
by
a
remarkably
noteworthy
rendering
of
the
immortal
thomas
osborne
davis
evergreen
verses
happily
too
familiar
to
need
recalling
here
a
nation
once
again
in
the
execution
of
which
the
veteran
patriot
champion
may
be
said
without
fear
of
contradiction
to
have
fairly
excelled
himself
the
irish
was
in
superlative
form
and
his
stentorian
notes
were
heard
to
the
greatest
advantage
in
the
timehonoured
anthem
sung
as
only
our
citizen
can
sing
it
his
superb
highclass
vocalism
which
by
its
superquality
greatly
enhanced
his
already
international
reputation
was
vociferously
applauded
by
the
large
audience
among
which
were
to
be
noticed
many
prominent

of

as

as

wind
queensberry
rules
and
all
made
him
puke
what
he
never
ate
it
was
a
historic
and
a
hefty
battle
when
myler
and
percy
were
scheduled
to
don
the
gloves
for
the
purse
of
fifty
sovereigns
handicapped
as
he
was
by
lack
of
poundage
dublin
s
pet
lamb
made
up
for
it
by
superlative
skill
in
ringcraft
the
final
bout
of
fireworks
was
a
gruelling
for
both
champions
the
welterweight
sergeantmajor
had
tapped
some
lively
claret
in
the
previous
mixup
during
which
keogh
had
been
receivergeneral
of
rights
and
lefts
the
artilleryman
putting
in
some
neat
work
on
the
pet
s
nose
and
myler
came
on
looking
groggy
the
soldier
got
to
business
leading
off
with
a
powerful
left
jab
to
which
the
irish
gladiator
retaliated
by
shooting
out
a
stiff
one
flush
to
the
point
of
bennett
s
jaw
the
redcoat
ducked
but
the
dubliner
lifted
him
with
a
left
hook
the
body
punch
being
a
fine
one
the
men
came
to
handigrips
myler
quickly
became
busy
and
got
his
man
under
the
bout
ending
with
the
bulkier
man
on
the
ropes
myler
punishing
him
the
englishman
whose
right
eye
was
nearly
closed
took
his
corner
where
he
was
liberally
drenched
with
water
and
when
the
bell
went
came
on
gamey
and
brimful
of
pluck
confident
of
knocking
out
the
fistic
eblanite
in
jigtime
it
was
a
fight
to
a
finish
and
the
best
man
for
it
the
two
fought
like
tigers
and
excitement
ran
fever
high
the
referee
twice
cautioned
pucking
percy
for
holding
but
the
pet
was
tricky
and
his
footwork
a
treat
to
watch
after
a
brisk
exchange
of
courtesies
during
which
a
smart
upper
cut
of
the
military
man
brought
blood
freely
from
his
opponent
s
mouth
the
lamb
suddenly
waded
in
all
over
his
man
and
landed
a
terrific
left
to
battling
bennett
s
stomach
flooring
him
flat
it
was
a
knockout
clean
and
clever
amid
tense
expectation
the
portobello
bruiser
was
being
counted
out
when
bennett
s
second
ole
pfotts
wettstein
threw
in
the
towel
and
the
santry
boy
was
declared
victor
to
the
frenzied
cheers
of
the
public
who
broke
through
the
ringropes
and
fairly
mobbed
him
with
delight
knows
which
side
his
bread
is
buttered
says

how
that
the

second
of

had
met
them
in
the
tholsel
and
there
after
due
prayers
to
the
gods
who
dwell
in
ether
supernal
had
taken
solemn
counsel
whereby
they
might
if

and
the

putting

and
says
john

and
says
lenehan
that

of
the

said
and
then
lifted
he
in
his

great
brawny

the
medher
of
dark
strong
foamy
ale
and
uttering
his
tribal
slogan
lamh
dearg
abu
he
drank
to
the
undoing
of
his
foes
a
race
of
mighty
valorous
heroes

silent
as

says
the

as
blind
as
the
fellow

t
see
if
you

what
that
means
where

our
missing

what
about

says
ned
that
keeps
our
foes
at

ll
tell
you
what
about
it
says
the
citizen
hell
upon

it
is
read
the
revelations
that
s
going
on
in
the
papers
about
flogging
on
the
training
ships
at
portsmouth
a
fellow
writes
that
calls
himself
disgusted
one
so
he
starts
telling
us
about
corporal
punishment
and
about
the
crew
of
tars
and
officers
and
rearadmirals
drawn
up
in
cocked
hats
and
the
parson
with
his
protestant
bible
to
witness
punishment
and
a
young
lad
brought
out
howling
for
his
ma
and
they
tie
him
down
on
the
buttend
of
a
gun
rump
and
dozen
says
the
citizen
was
what
that
old
ruffian
sir
john
beresford
called
it
but
the
modern
god
s
englishman
calls
it
caning
on
the
breech
and
says
john
wyse
tis
a
custom
more
honoured
in
the
breach
than
in
the
observance
then
he
was
telling
us
the
master
at
arms
comes
along
with
a
long
cane
and
he
draws
out
and
he
flogs
the
bloody
backside
off
of
the
poor
lad
till
he
yells
meila
murder
s
your
glorious
british
navy
says
the
citizen
that
bosses
the
earth
the
fellows
that
never
will
be
slaves
with
the
only
hereditary
chamber
on
the
face
of
god
s
earth
and
their
land
in
the
hands
of
a
dozen
gamehogs
and
cottonball
barons
that
s
the
great
empire
they
boast
about
of
drudges
and
whipped
serfs
which
the
sun
never
rises
says
joe
the
tragedy
of
it
is
says
the
citizen
they
believe
it
the
unfortunate
yahoos
believe
it
they
believe
in
rod
the
scourger
almighty
creator
of
hell
upon
earth
and
in
jacky
tar
the
son
of
a
gun
who
was
conceived
of
unholy
boast
born
of
the
fighting
navy
suffered
under
rump
and
dozen
was
scarified
flayed
and
curried
yelled
like

hell
the
third

he
arose
again
from

steered
into

on
his

till
further
orders
whence
he
shall
come
to

paid
says

isn

discipline
the
same
everywhere
i
mean
wouldn
t
it
be
the
same
here
if
you
put
force
against
force
didn
t
i
tell
you
as
true
as
i
m
drinking
this
porter
if
he
was
at
his
last
gasp
he
d
try
to
downface
you
that
dying
was
living
ll
put
force
against
force
says
the
citizen
we
have
our
greater
ireland
beyond
the
sea
they
were
driven
out
of
house
and
home
in
the
black
their
mudcabins
and
their
shielings
by
the
roadside
were
laid
low
by
the
batteringram
and
the
times
rubbed
its
hands
and
told
the
whitelivered
saxons
there
would
soon
be
as
few
irish
in
ireland
as
redskins
in
america
even
the
grand
turk
sent
us
his
piastres
but
the
sassenach
tried
to
starve
the
nation
at
home
while
the
land
was
full
of
crops
that
the
british
hyenas
bought
and
sold
in
rio
de
janeiro
ay
they
drove
out
the
peasants
in
hordes
twenty
thousand
of
them
died
in
the
coffinships
but
those
that
came
to
the
land
of
the
free
remember
the
land
of
bondage
and
they
will
come
again
and
with
a
vengeance
no
cravens
the
sons
of
granuaile
the
champions
of
kathleen
ni
houlihan
true
says
bloom
but
my
point
was
are
a
long
time
waiting
for
that
day
citizen
says
ned
since
the
poor
old
woman
told
us
that
the
french
were
on
the
sea
and
landed
at
killala
says
john
wyse
we
fought
for
the
royal
stuarts
that
reneged
us
against
the
williamites
and
they
betrayed
us
remember
limerick
and
the
broken
treatystone
we
gave
our
best
blood
to
france
and
spain
the
wild
geese
fontenoy
eh
and
sarsfield
and
o
donnell
duke
of
tetuan
in
spain
and
ulysses
browne
of
camus
that
was
fieldmarshal
to
maria
teresa
but
what
did
we
ever
get
for
it
french
says
the

of
dancing
masters
do
you

what
it
is
they
were
never

from
george

the
german

and
the
flatulent
old
bitch
that

to
laugh
at
the

he
came
out
with
that
about

pulling
him
by

old

about

on

rhine
and
come
where

says
j
we

edward

now
that
to
a
fool
says
the

there
s
a
bloody
sight
more
pox
than

about
that
boyo
edward
what
do
you
think
says
joe
of
the
holy
boys
the
priests
and
bishops
of

doing
up
his
room
in
maynooth
in
his
satanic

the

no

quite
excited
with
his
dunducketymudcoloured
mug
on
him
and
his
old
plumeyes
rolling
about
says
he
all
the
history
of

is
full
of
it
perpetuating
national
hatred
among

do
you
know
what
a

means
says
john

says

is
it
says
john

so
i
m
a

at

muck
out
of

could
never

life
always
with
a
laugh
in
her
gipsylike
eyes
and
a
frolicsome
word
on
her
cherryripe
red
lips
a
girl
lovable
in
the
extreme
and
edy
boardman
laughed
too
at
the
quaint
language
of
little
brother
but
just
then
there
was
a
slight
altercation
between
master
tommy
and
master
jacky
boys
will
be
boys
and
our
two
twins
were
no
exception
to
this
golden
rule
the
apple
of
discord
was
a
certain
castle
of
sand
which
master
jacky
had
built
and
master
tommy
would
have
it
right
go
wrong
that
it
was
to
be
architecturally
improved
by
a
frontdoor
like
the
martello
tower
had
but
if
master
tommy
was
headstrong
master
jacky
was
selfwilled
too
and
true
to
the
maxim
that
every
little
irishman
s
house
is
his
castle
he
fell
upon
his
hated
rival
and
to
such
purpose
that
the
wouldbe
assailant
came
to
grief
and
alas
to
relate
the
coveted
castle
too
needless
to
say
the
cries
of
discomfited
master
tommy
drew
the
attention
of
the
girl
friends
here
tommy
his
sister
called
imperatively
at
once
and
you
jacky
for
shame
to
throw
poor
tommy
in
the
dirty
sand
wait
till
i
catch
you
for
that
his
eyes
misty
with
unshed
tears
master
tommy
came
at
her
call
for
their
big
sister
s
word
was
law
with
the
twins
and
in
a
sad
plight
he
was
too
after
his
misadventure
his
little
top
and
unmentionables
were
full
of
sand
but
cissy
was
a
past
mistress
in
the
art
of
smoothing
over
life
s
tiny
troubles
and
very
quickly
not
one
speck
of
sand
was
to
be
seen
on
his
smart
little
suit
still
the
blue
eyes
were
glistening
with
hot
tears
that
would
well
up
so
she
kissed
away
the
hurtness
and
shook
her
hand
at
master
jacky
the
culprit
and
said
if
she
was
near
him
she
wouldn
t
be
far
from
him
her
eyes
dancing
in
admonition
bold
jacky
she
cried
she
put
an
arm
round
the
little
mariner
and
coaxed
winningly
s
your
name
butter
and
cream
us
who
is
your
sweetheart
spoke
edy
boardman
is
cissy
your
sweetheart
tearful
tommy
said
edy
boardman
your
sweetheart
cissy
queried
tommy
said
know
edy
boardman
said
none
too
amiably
with
an
arch
glance
from
her
shortsighted
eyes
i
know
who
is
tommy
s
sweetheart
gerty
is
tommy
s
sweetheart
tommy
said
on
the
verge
of
tears
cissy
s
quick
motherwit
guessed
what
was
amiss
and
she
whispered
to
edy
boardman
to
take
him
there
behind
the
pushcar
where
the
gentleman
couldn
t
see
and
to
mind
he
didn
t
wet
his
new
tan
shoes
but
who
was
gerty
gerty
macdowell
who
was
seated
near
her
companions
lost
in
thought
gazing
far
away
into
the
distance
was
in
very
truth
as
fair
a
specimen
of
winsome
irish
girlhood
as
one
could
wish
to
see
she
was
pronounced
beautiful
by
all
who
knew
her
though
as
folks
often
said
she
was
more
a
giltrap
than
a
macdowell
her
figure
was
slight
and
graceful
inclining
even
to
fragility
but
those
iron
jelloids
she
had
been
taking
of
late
had
done
her
a
world
of
good
much
better
than
the
widow
welch
s
female
pills
and
she
was
much
better
of
those
discharges
she
used
to
get
and
that
tired
feeling
the
waxen
pallor
of
her
face
was
almost
spiritual
in
its
ivorylike
purity
though
her
rosebud
mouth
was
a
genuine
cupid
s
bow
greekly
perfect
her
hands
were
of
finely
veined
alabaster
with
tapering
fingers
and
as
white
as
lemonjuice
and
queen
of
ointments
could
make
them
though
it
was
not
true
that
she
used
to
wear
kid
gloves
in
bed
or
take
a
milk
footbath
either
bertha
supple
told
that
once
to
edy
boardman
a
deliberate
lie
when
she
was
black
out
at
daggers
drawn
with
gerty
the
girl
chums
had
of
course
their
little
tiffs
from
time
to
time
like
the
rest
of
mortals
and
she
told
her
not
to
let
on
whatever
she
did
that
it
was
her
that
told
her
or
she
d
never
speak
to
her
again
no
honour
where
honour
is
due
there
was
an
innate
refinement
a
languid
queenly
hauteur
about
gerty
which
was
unmistakably
evidenced
in
her
delicate
hands
and
higharched
instep
had
kind
fate
but
willed
her
to
be
born
a
gentlewoman
of
high
degree
in
her
own
right
and
had
she
only
received
the
benefit
of
a
good
education
gerty
macdowell
might
easily
have
held
her
own
beside
any
lady
in
the
land
and
have
seen
herself
exquisitely
gowned
with
jewels
on
her
brow
and
patrician
suitors
at
her
feet
vying
with
one
another
to
pay
their
devoirs
to
her
mayhap
it
was
this
the
love
that
might
have
been
that
lent
to
her
softlyfeatured
face
at
whiles
a
look
tense
with
suppressed
meaning
that
imparted
a
strange
yearning
tendency
to
the
beautiful
eyes
a
charm
few
could
resist
why
have
women
such
eyes
of
witchery
gerty
s
were
of
the
bluest
irish
blue
set
off
by
lustrous
lashes
and
dark
expressive
brows
time
was
when
those
brows
were
not
so
silkily
seductive
it
was
madame
vera
verity
directress
of
the
woman
beautiful
page
of
the
princess
novelette
who
had
first
advised
her
to
try
eyebrowleine
which
gave
that
haunting
expression
to
the
eyes
so
becoming
in
leaders
of
fashion
and
she
had
never
regretted
it
then
there
was
blushing
scientifically
cured
and
how
to
be
tall
increase
your
height
and
you
have
a
beautiful
face
but
your
nose
that
would
suit
mrs
dignam
because
she
had
a
button
one
but
gerty
s
crowning
glory
was
her
wealth
of
wonderful
hair
it
was
dark
brown
with
a
natural
wave
in
it
she
had
cut
it
that
very
morning
on
account
of
the
new
moon
and
it
nestled
about
her
pretty
head
in
a
profusion
of
luxuriant
clusters
and
pared
her
nails
too
thursday
for
wealth
and
just
now
at
edy
s
words
as
a
telltale
flush
delicate
as
the
faintest
rosebloom
crept
into
her
cheeks
she
looked
so
lovely
in
her
sweet
girlish
shyness
that
of
a
surety
god
s
fair
land
of
ireland
did
not
hold
her
equal
for
an
instant
she
was
silent
with
rather
sad
downcast
eyes
she
was
about
to
retort
but
something
checked
the
words
on
her
tongue
inclination
prompted
her
to
speak
out
dignity
told
her
to
be
silent
the
pretty
lips
pouted
awhile
but
then
she
glanced
up
and
broke
out
into
a
joyous
little
laugh
which
had
in
it
all
the
freshness
of
a
young
may
morning
she
knew
right
well
better
what
made
squinty
edy
say
that
because
of
him
cooling
in
his
attentions
when
it
was
simply
a
lovers
quarrel
as
per
usual
somebody
s
nose
was
out
of
joint
about
the
boy
that
had
the
bicycle
off
the
london
bridge
road
always
riding
up
and
down
in
front
of
her
window
only
now
his
father
kept
him
in
in
the
evenings
studying
hard
to
get
an
exhibition
in
the
intermediate
that
was
on
and
he
was
going
to
go
to
trinity
college
to
study
for
a
doctor
when
he
left
the
high
school
like
his
brother
wylie
who
was
racing
in
the
bicycle
races
in
trinity
college
university
little
recked
he
perhaps
for
what
she
felt
that
dull
aching
void
in
her
heart
sometimes
piercing
to
the
core
yet
he
was
young
and
perchance
he
might
learn
to
love
her
in
time
they
were
protestants
in
his
family
and
of
course
gerty
knew
who
came
first
and
after
him
the
blessed
virgin
and
then
saint
joseph
but
he
was
undeniably
handsome
with
an
exquisite
nose
and
he
was
what
he
looked
every
inch
a
gentleman
the
shape
of
his
head
too
at
the
back
without
his
cap
on
that
she
would
know
anywhere
something
off
the
common
and
the
way
he
turned
the
bicycle
at
the
lamp
with
his
hands
off
the
bars
and
also
the
nice
perfume
of
those
good
cigarettes
and
besides
they
were
both
of
a
size
too
he
and
she
and
that
was
why
edy
boardman
thought
she
was
so
frightfully
clever
because
he
didn
t
go
and
ride
up
and
down
in
front
of
her
bit
of
a
garden
gerty
was
dressed
simply
but
with
the
instinctive
taste
of
a
votary
of
dame
fashion
for
she
felt
that
there
was
just
a
might
that
he
might
be
out
a
neat
blouse
of
electric
blue
selftinted
by
dolly
dyes
because
it
was
expected
in
the
lady
s
pictorial
that
electric
blue
would
be
worn
with
a
smart
vee
opening
down
to
the
division
and
kerchief
pocket
in
which
she
always
kept
a
piece
of
cottonwool
scented
with
her
favourite
perfume
because
the
handkerchief
spoiled
the
sit
and
a
navy
threequarter
skirt
cut
to
the
stride
showed
off
her
slim
graceful
figure
to
perfection
she
wore
a
coquettish
little
love
of
a
hat
of
wideleaved
nigger
straw
contrast
trimmed
with
an
underbrim
of
eggblue
chenille
and
at
the
side
a
butterfly
bow
of
silk
to
tone
all
tuesday
week
afternoon
she
was
hunting
to
match
that
chenille
but
at
last
she
found
what
she
wanted
at
clery
s
summer
sales
the
very
it
slightly
shopsoiled
but
you
would
never
notice
seven
fingers
two
and
a
penny
she
did
it
up
all
by
herself
and
what
joy
was
hers
when
she
tried
it
on
then
smiling
at
the
lovely
reflection
which
the
mirror
gave
back
to
her
and
when
she
put
it
on
the
waterjug
to
keep
the
shape
she
knew
that
that
would
take
the
shine
out
of
some
people
she
knew
her
shoes
were
the
newest
thing
in
footwear
edy
boardman
prided
herself
that
she
was
very
petite
but
she
never
had
a
foot
like
gerty
macdowell
a
five
and
never
would
ash
oak
or
elm
with
patent
toecaps
and
just
one
smart
buckle
over
her
higharched
instep
her
wellturned
ankle
displayed
its
perfect
proportions
beneath
her
skirt
and
just
the
proper
amount
and
no
more
of
her
shapely
limbs
encased
in
finespun
hose
with
highspliced
heels
and
wide
garter
tops
as
for
undies
they
were
gerty
s
chief
care
and
who
that
knows
the
fluttering
hopes
and
fears
of
sweet
seventeen
though
gerty
would
never
see
seventeen
again
can
find
it
in
his
heart
to
blame
her
she
had
four
dinky
sets
with
awfully
pretty
stitchery
three
garments
and
nighties
extra
and
each
set
slotted
with
different
coloured
ribbons
rosepink
pale
blue
mauve
and
peagreen
and
she
aired
them
herself
and
blued
them
when
they
came
home
from
the
wash
and
ironed
them
and
she
had
a
brickbat
to
keep
the
iron
on
because
she
wouldn
t
trust
those
washerwomen
as
far
as
she
d
see
them
scorching
the
things
she
was
wearing
the
blue
for
luck
hoping
against
hope
her
own
colour
and
lucky
too
for
a
bride
to
have
a
bit
of
blue
somewhere
on
her
because
the
green
she
wore
that
day
week
brought
grief
because
his
father
brought
him
in
to
study
for
the
intermediate
exhibition
and
because
she
thought
perhaps
he
might
be
out
because
when
she
was
dressing
that
morning
she
nearly
slipped
up
the
old
pair
on
her
inside
out
and
that
was
for
luck
and
lovers
meeting
if
you
put
those
things
on
inside
out
or
if
they
got
untied
that
he
was
thinking
about
you
so
long
as
it
wasn
t
of
a
friday
and
yet
and
yet
that
strained
look
on
her
face
a
gnawing
sorrow
is
there
all
the
time
her
very
soul
is
in
her
eyes
and
she
would
give
worlds
to
be
in
the
privacy
of
her
own
familiar
chamber
where
giving
way
to
tears
she
could
have
a
good
cry
and
relieve
her
pentup
feelings
though
not
too
much
because
she
knew
how
to
cry
nicely
before
the
mirror
you
are
lovely
gerty
it
said
the
paly
light
of
evening
falls
upon
a
face
infinitely
sad
and
wistful
gerty
macdowell
yearns
in
vain
yes
she
had
known
from
the
very
first
that
her
daydream
of
a
marriage
has
been
arranged
and
the
weddingbells
ringing
for
mrs
reggy
wylie
because
the
one
who
married
the
elder
brother
would
be
mrs
wylie
and
in
the
fashionable
intelligence
mrs
gertrude
wylie
was
wearing
a
sumptuous
confection
of
grey
trimmed
with
expensive
blue
fox
was
not
to
be
he
was
too
young
to
understand
he
would
not
believe
in
love
a
woman
s
birthright
the
night
of
the
party
long
ago
in
stoer
s
he
was
still
in
short
trousers
when
they
were
alone
and
he
stole
an
arm
round
her
waist
she
went
white
to
the
very
lips
he
called
her
little
one
in
a
strangely
husky
voice
and
snatched
a
half
kiss
the
first
but
it
was
only
the
end
of
her
nose
and
then
he
hastened
from
the
room
with
a
remark
about
refreshments
impetuous
fellow
strength
of
character
had
never
been
reggy
wylie
s
strong
point
and
he
who
would
woo
and
win
gerty
macdowell
must
be
a
man
among
men
but
waiting
always
waiting
to
be
asked
and
it
was
leap
year
too
and
would
soon
be
over
no
prince
charming
is
her
beau
ideal
to
lay
a
rare
and
wondrous
love
at
her
feet
but
rather
a
manly
man
with
a
strong
quiet
face
who
had
not
found
his
ideal
perhaps
his
hair
slightly
flecked
with
grey
and
who
would
understand
take
her
in
his
sheltering
arms
strain
her
to
him
in
all
the
strength
of
his
deep
passionate
nature
and
comfort
her
with
a
long
long
kiss
it
would
be
like
heaven
for
such
a
one
she
yearns
this
balmy
summer
eve
with
all
the
heart
of
her
she
longs
to
be
his
only
his
affianced
bride
for
riches
for
poor
in
sickness
in
health
till
death
us
two
part
from
this
to
this
day
forward
and
while
edy
boardman
was
with
little
tommy
behind
the
pushcar
she
was
just
thinking
would
the
day
ever
come
when
she
could
call
herself
his
little
wife
to
be
then
they
could
talk
about
her
till
they
went
blue
in
the
face
bertha
supple
too
and
edy
little
spitfire
because
she
would
be
twentytwo
in
november
she
would
care
for
him
with
creature
comforts
too
for
gerty
was
womanly
wise
and
knew
that
a
mere
man
liked
that
feeling
of
hominess
her
griddlecakes
done
to
a
goldenbrown
hue
and
queen
ann
s
pudding
of
delightful
creaminess
had
won
golden
opinions
from
all
because
she
had
a
lucky
hand
also
for
lighting
a
fire
dredge
in
the
fine
selfraising
flour
and
always
stir
in
the
same
direction
then
cream
the
milk
and
sugar
and
whisk
well
the
white
of
eggs
though
she
didn
t
like
the
eating
part
when
there
were
any
people
that
made
her
shy
and
often
she
wondered
why
you
couldn
t
eat
something
poetical
like
violets
or
roses
and
they
would
have
a
beautifully
appointed
drawingroom
with
pictures
and
engravings
and
the
photograph
of
grandpapa
giltrap
s
lovely
dog
garryowen
that
almost
talked
it
was
so
human
and
chintz
covers
for
the
chairs
and
that
silver
toastrack
in
clery
s
summer
jumble
sales
like
they
have
in
rich
houses
he
would
be
tall
with
broad
shoulders
she
had
always
admired
tall
men
for
a
husband
with
glistening
white
teeth
under
his
carefully
trimmed
sweeping
moustache
and
they
would
go
on
the
continent
for
their
honeymoon
three
wonderful
weeks
and
then
when
they
settled
down
in
a
nice
snug
and
cosy
little
homely
house
every
morning
they
would
both
have
brekky
simple
but
perfectly
served
for
their
own
two
selves
and
before
he
went
out
to
business
he
would
give
his
dear
little
wifey
a
good
hearty
hug
and
gaze
for
a
moment
deep
down
into
her
eyes
edy
boardman
asked
tommy
caffrey
was
he
done
and
he
said
yes
so
then
she
buttoned
up
his
little
knickerbockers
for
him
and
told
him
to
run
off
and
play
with
jacky
and
to
be
good
now
and
not
to
fight
but
tommy
said
he
wanted
the
ball
and
edy
told
him
no
that
baby
was
playing
with
the
ball
and
if
he
took
it
there
d
be
wigs
on
the
green
but
tommy
said
it
was
his
ball
and
he
wanted
his
ball
and
he
pranced
on
the
ground
if
you
please
the
temper
of
him
o
he
was
a
man
already
was
little
tommy
caffrey
since
he
was
out
of
pinnies
edy
told
him
no
no
and
to
be
off
now
with
him
and
she
told
cissy
caffrey
not
to
give
in
to
him
re
not
my
sister
naughty
tommy
said
it
s
my
ball
but
cissy
caffrey
told
baby
boardman
to
look
up
look
up
high
at
her
finger
and
she
snatched
the
ball
quickly
and
threw
it
along
the
sand
and
tommy
after
it
in
full
career
having
won
the
day
for
a
quiet
life
laughed
ciss
and
she
tickled
tiny
tot
s
two
cheeks
to
make
him
forget
and
played
here
s
the
lord
mayor
here
s
his
two
horses
here
s
his
gingerbread
carriage
and
here
he
walks
in
chinchopper
chinchopper
chinchopper
chin
but
edy
got
as
cross
as
two
sticks
about
him
getting
his
own
way
like
that
from
everyone
always
petting
him
d
like
to
give
him
something
she
said
so
i
would
where
i
won
t
say
the
beeoteetom
laughed
cissy
merrily
gerty
macdowell
bent
down
her
head
and
crimsoned
at
the
idea
of
cissy
saying
an
unladylike
thing
like
that
out
loud
she
d
be
ashamed
of
her
life
to
say
flushing
a
deep
rosy
red
and
edy
boardman
said
she
was
sure
the
gentleman
opposite
heard
what
she
said
but
not
a
pin
cared
ciss
him
she
said
with
a
pert
toss
of
her
head
and
a
piquant
tilt
of
her
nose
give
it
to
him
too
on
the
same
place
as
quick
as
i
d
look
at
him
madcap
ciss
with
her
golliwog
curls
you
had
to
laugh
at
her
sometimes
for
instance
when
she
asked
you
would
you
have
some
more
chinese
tea
and
jaspberry
ram
and
when
she
drew
the
jugs
too
and
the
men
s
faces
on
her
nails
with
red
ink
make
you
split
your
sides
or
when
she
wanted
to
go
where
you
know
she
said
she
wanted
to
run
and
pay
a
visit
to
the
miss
white
that
was
just
like
cissycums
o
and
will
you
ever
forget
her
the
evening
she
dressed
up
in
her
father
s
suit
and
hat
and
the
burned
cork
moustache
and
walked
down
tritonville
road
smoking
a
cigarette
there
was
none
to
come
up
to
her
for
fun
but
she
was
sincerity
itself
one
of
the
bravest
and
truest
hearts
heaven
ever
made
not
one
of
your
twofaced
things
too
sweet
to
be
wholesome
and
then
there
came
out
upon
the
air
the
sound
of
voices
and
the
pealing
anthem
of
the
organ
it
was
the
men
s
temperance
retreat
conducted
by
the
missioner
the
reverend
john
hughes
rosary
sermon
and
benediction
of
the
most
blessed
sacrament
they
were
there
gathered
together
without
distinction
of
social
class
and
a
most
edifying
spectacle
it
was
to
see
in
that
simple
fane
beside
the
waves
after
the
storms
of
this
weary
world
kneeling
before
the
feet
of
the
immaculate
reciting
the
litany
of
our
lady
of
loreto
beseeching
her
to
intercede
for
them
the
old
familiar
words
holy
mary
holy
virgin
of
virgins
how
sad
to
poor
gerty
s
ears
had
her
father
only
avoided
the
clutches
of
the
demon
drink
by
taking
the
pledge
or
those
powders
the
drink
habit
cured
in
pearson
s
weekly
she
might
now
be
rolling
in
her
carriage
second
to
none
over
and
over
had
she
told
herself
that
as
she
mused
by
the
dying
embers
in
a
brown
study
without
the
lamp
because
she
hated
two
lights
or
oftentimes
gazing
out
of
the
window
dreamily
by
the
hour
at
the
rain
falling
on
the
rusty
bucket
thinking
but
that
vile
decoction
which
has
ruined
so
many
hearths
and
homes
had
cast
its
shadow
over
her
childhood
days
nay
she
had
even
witnessed
in
the
home
circle
deeds
of
violence
caused
by
intemperance
and
had
seen
her
own
father
a
prey
to
the
fumes
of
intoxication
forget
himself
completely
for
if
there
was
one
thing
of
all
things
that
gerty
knew
it
was
that
the
man
who
lifts
his
hand
to
a
woman
save
in
the
way
of
kindness
deserves
to
be
branded
as
the
lowest
of
the
low
and
still
the
voices
sang
in
supplication
to
the
virgin
most
powerful
virgin
most
merciful
and
gerty
rapt
in
thought
scarce
saw
or
heard
her
companions
or
the
twins
at
their
boyish
gambols
or
the
gentleman
off
sandymount
green
that
cissy
caffrey
called
the
man
that
was
so
like
himself
passing
along
the
strand
taking
a
short
walk
you
never
saw
him
any
way
screwed
but
still
and
for
all
that
she
would
not
like
him
for
a
father
because
he
was
too
old
or
something
or
on
account
of
his
face
it
was
a
palpable
case
of
doctor
fell
or
his
carbuncly
nose
with
the
pimples
on
it
and
his
sandy
moustache
a
bit
white
under
his
nose
poor
father
with
all
his
faults
she
loved
him
still
when
he
sang
tell
me
mary
how
to
woo
thee
or
my
love
and
cottage
near
rochelle
and
they
had
stewed
cockles
and
lettuce
with
lazenby
s
salad
dressing
for
supper
and
when
he
sang
the
moon
hath
raised
with
mr
dignam
that
died
suddenly
and
was
buried
god
have
mercy
on
him
from
a
stroke
her
mother
s
birthday
that
was
and
charley
was
home
on
his
holidays
and
tom
and
mr
dignam
and
mrs
and
patsy
and
freddy
dignam
and
they
were
to
have
had
a
group
taken
would
have
thought
the
end
was
so
near
now
he
was
laid
to
rest
and
her
mother
said
to
him
to
let
that
be
a
warning
to
him
for
the
rest
of
his
days
and
he
couldn
t
even
go
to
the
funeral
on
account
of
the
gout
and
she
had
to
go
into
town
to
bring
him
the
letters
and
samples
from
his
office
about
catesby
s
cork
lino
artistic
standard
designs
fit
for
a
palace
gives
tiptop
wear
and
always
bright
and
cheery
in
the
home
a
sterling
good
daughter
was
gerty
just
like
a
second
mother
in
the
house
a
ministering
angel
too
with
a
little
heart
worth
its
weight
in
gold
and
when
her
mother
had
those
raging
splitting
headaches
who
was
it
rubbed
the
menthol
cone
on
her
forehead
but
gerty
though
she
didn
t
like
her
mother
s
taking
pinches
of
snuff
and
that
was
the
only
single
thing
they
ever
had
words
about
taking
snuff
everyone
thought
the
world
of
her
for
her
gentle
ways
it
was
gerty
who
turned
off
the
gas
at
the
main
every
night
and
it
was
gerty
who
tacked
up
on
the
wall
of
that
place
where
she
never
forgot
every
fortnight
the
chlorate
of
lime
mr
tunney
the
grocer
s
christmas
almanac
the
picture
of
halcyon
days
where
a
young
gentleman
in
the
costume
they
used
to
wear
then
with
a
threecornered
hat
was
offering
a
bunch
of
flowers
to
his
ladylove
with
oldtime
chivalry
through
her
lattice
window
you
could
see
there
was
a
story
behind
it
the
colours
were
done
something
lovely
she
was
in
a
soft
clinging
white
in
a
studied
attitude
and
the
gentleman
was
in
chocolate
and
he
looked
a
thorough
aristocrat
she
often
looked
at
them
dreamily
when
she
went
there
for
a
certain
purpose
and
felt
her
own
arms
that
were
white
and
soft
just
like
hers
with
the
sleeves
back
and
thought
about
those
times
because
she
had
found
out
in
walker
s
pronouncing
dictionary
that
belonged
to
grandpapa
giltrap
about
the
halcyon
days
what
they
meant
the
twins
were
now
playing
in
the
most
approved
brotherly
fashion
till
at
last
master
jacky
who
was
really
as
bold
as
brass
there
was
no
getting
behind
that
deliberately
kicked
the
ball
as
hard
as
ever
he
could
down
towards
the
seaweedy
rocks
needless
to
say
poor
tommy
was
not
slow
to
voice
his
dismay
but
luckily
the
gentleman
in
black
who
was
sitting
there
by
himself
came
gallantly
to
the
rescue
and
intercepted
the
ball
our
two
champions
claimed
their
plaything
with
lusty
cries
and
to
avoid
trouble
cissy
caffrey
called
to
the
gentleman
to
throw
it
to
her
please
the
gentleman
aimed
the
ball
once
or
twice
and
then
threw
it
up
the
strand
towards
cissy
caffrey
but
it
rolled
down
the
slope
and
stopped
right
under
gerty
s
skirt
near
the
little
pool
by
the
rock
the
twins
clamoured
again
for
it
and
cissy
told
her
to
kick
it
away
and
let
them
fight
for
it
so
gerty
drew
back
her
foot
but
she
wished
their
stupid
ball
hadn
t
come
rolling
down
to
her
and
she
gave
a
kick
but
she
missed
and
edy
and
cissy
laughed
you
fail
try
again
edy
boardman
said
gerty
smiled
assent
and
bit
her
lip
a
delicate
pink
crept
into
her
pretty
cheek
but
she
was
determined
to
let
them
see
so
she
just
lifted
her
skirt
a
little
but
just
enough
and
took
good
aim
and
gave
the
ball
a
jolly
good
kick
and
it
went
ever
so
far
and
the
two
twins
after
it
down
towards
the
shingle
pure
jealousy
of
course
it
was
nothing
else
to
draw
attention
on
account
of
the
gentleman
opposite
looking
she
felt
the
warm
flush
a
danger
signal
always
with
gerty
macdowell
surging
and
flaming
into
her
cheeks
till
then
they
had
only
exchanged
glances
of
the
most
casual
but
now
under
the
brim
of
her
new
hat
she
ventured
a
look
at
him
and
the
face
that
met
her
gaze
there
in
the
twilight
wan
and
strangely
drawn
seemed
to
her
the
saddest
she
had
ever
seen
through
the
open
window
of
the
church
the
fragrant
incense
was
wafted
and
with
it
the
fragrant
names
of
her
who
was
conceived
without
stain
of
original
sin
spiritual
vessel
pray
for
us
honourable
vessel
pray
for
us
vessel
of
singular
devotion
pray
for
us
mystical
rose
and
careworn
hearts
were
there
and
toilers
for
their
daily
bread
and
many
who
had
erred
and
wandered
their
eyes
wet
with
contrition
but
for
all
that
bright
with
hope
for
the
reverend
father
father
hughes
had
told
them
what
the
great
saint
bernard
said
in
his
famous
prayer
of
mary
the
most
pious
virgin
s
intercessory
power
that
it
was
not
recorded
in
any
age
that
those
who
implored
her
powerful
protection
were
ever
abandoned
by
her
the
twins
were
now
playing
again
right
merrily
for
the
troubles
of
childhood
are
but
as
fleeting
summer
showers
cissy
caffrey
played
with
baby
boardman
till
he
crowed
with
glee
clapping
baby
hands
in
air
peep
she
cried
behind
the
hood
of
the
pushcar
and
edy
asked
where
was
cissy
gone
and
then
cissy
popped
up
her
head
and
cried
ah
and
my
word
didn
t
the
little
chap
enjoy
that
and
then
she
told
him
to
say
papa
papa
baby
say
pa
pa
pa
pa
pa
pa
and
baby
did
his
level
best
to
say
it
for
he
was
very
intelligent
for
eleven
months
everyone
said
and
big
for
his
age
and
the
picture
of
health
a
perfect
little
bunch
of
love
and
he
would
certainly
turn
out
to
be
something
great
they
said
ja
ja
haja
cissy
wiped
his
little
mouth
with
the
dribbling
bib
and
wanted
him
to
sit
up
properly
and
say
pa
pa
pa
but
when
she
undid
the
strap
she
cried
out
holy
saint
denis
that
he
was
possing
wet
and
to
double
the
half
blanket
the
other
way
under
him
of
course
his
infant
majesty
was
most
obstreperous
at
such
toilet
formalities
and
he
let
everyone
know
it
baaaahabaaa
baaaa
and
two
great
big
lovely
big
tears
coursing
down
his
cheeks
it
was
all
no
use
soothering
him
with
no
nono
baby
no
and
telling
him
about
the
geegee
and
where
was
the
puffpuff
but
ciss
always
readywitted
gave
him
in
his
mouth
the
teat
of
the
suckingbottle
and
the
young
heathen
was
quickly
appeased
gerty
wished
to
goodness
they
would
take
their
squalling
baby
home
out
of
that
and
not
get
on
her
nerves
no
hour
to
be
out
and
the
little
brats
of
twins
she
gazed
out
towards
the
distant
sea
it
was
like
the
paintings
that
man
used
to
do
on
the
pavement
with
all
the
coloured
chalks
and
such
a
pity
too
leaving
them
there
to
be
all
blotted
out
the
evening
and
the
clouds
coming
out
and
the
bailey
light
on
howth
and
to
hear
the
music
like
that
and
the
perfume
of
those
incense
they
burned
in
the
church
like
a
kind
of
waft
and
while
she
gazed
her
heart
went
pitapat
yes
it
was
her
he
was
looking
at
and
there
was
meaning
in
his
look
his
eyes
burned
into
her
as
though
they
would
search
her
through
and
through
read
her
very
soul
wonderful
eyes
they
were
superbly
expressive
but
could
you
trust
them
people
were
so
queer
she
could
see
at
once
by
his
dark
eyes
and
his
pale
intellectual
face
that
he
was
a
foreigner
the
image
of
the
photo
she
had
of
martin
harvey
the
matinee
idol
only
for
the
moustache
which
she
preferred
because
she
wasn
t
stagestruck
like
winny
rippingham
that
wanted
they
two
to
always
dress
the
same
on
account
of
a
play
but
she
could
not
see
whether
he
had
an
aquiline
nose
or
a
slightly
retroussé
from
where
he
was
sitting
he
was
in
deep
mourning
she
could
see
that
and
the
story
of
a
haunting
sorrow
was
written
on
his
face
she
would
have
given
worlds
to
know
what
it
was
he
was
looking
up
so
intently
so
still
and
he
saw
her
kick
the
ball
and
perhaps
he
could
see
the
bright
steel
buckles
of
her
shoes
if
she
swung
them
like
that
thoughtfully
with
the
toes
down
she
was
glad
that
something
told
her
to
put
on
the
transparent
stockings
thinking
reggy
wylie
might
be
out
but
that
was
far
away
here
was
that
of
which
she
had
so
often
dreamed
it
was
he
who
mattered
and
there
was
joy
on
her
face
because
she
wanted
him
because
she
felt
instinctively
that
he
was
like
else
the
very
heart
of
the
girlwoman
went
out
to
him
her
dreamhusband
because
she
knew
on
the
instant
it
was
him
if
he
had
suffered
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
or
even
even
if
he
had
been
himself
a
sinner
a
wicked
man
she
cared
not
even
if
he
was
a
protestant
or
methodist
she
could
convert
him
easily
if
he
truly
loved
her
there
were
wounds
that
wanted
healing
with
heartbalm
she
was
a
womanly
woman
not
like
other
flighty
girls
unfeminine
he
had
known
those
cyclists
showing
off
what
they
hadn
t
got
and
she
just
yearned
to
know
all
to
forgive
all
if
she
could
make
him
fall
in
love
with
her
make
him
forget
the
memory
of
the
past
then
mayhap
he
would
embrace
her
gently
like
a
real
man
crushing
her
soft
body
to
him
and
love
her
his
ownest
girlie
for
herself
alone
refuge
of
sinners
comfortress
of
the
afflicted
ora
pro
nobis
well
has
it
been
said
that
whosoever
prays
to
her
with
faith
and
constancy
can
never
be
lost
or
cast
away
and
fitly
is
she
too
a
haven
of
refuge
for
the
afflicted
because
of
the
seven
dolours
which
transpierced
her
own
heart
gerty
could
picture
the
whole
scene
in
the
church
the
stained
glass
windows
lighted
up
the
candles
the
flowers
and
the
blue
banners
of
the
blessed
virgin
s
sodality
and
father
conroy
was
helping
canon
o
hanlon
at
the
altar
carrying
things
in
and
out
with
his
eyes
cast
down
he
looked
almost
a
saint
and
his
confessionbox
was
so
quiet
and
clean
and
dark
and
his
hands
were
just
like
white
wax
and
if
ever
she
became
a
dominican
nun
in
their
white
habit
perhaps
he
might
come
to
the
convent
for
the
novena
of
saint
dominic
he
told
her
that
time
when
she
told
him
about
that
in
confession
crimsoning
up
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
for
fear
he
could
see
not
to
be
troubled
because
that
was
only
the
voice
of
nature
and
we
were
all
subject
to
nature
s
laws
he
said
in
this
life
and
that
that
was
no
sin
because
that
came
from
the
nature
of
woman
instituted
by
god
he
said
and
that
our
blessed
lady
herself
said
to
the
archangel
gabriel
be
it
done
unto
me
according
to
thy
word
he
was
so
kind
and
holy
and
often
and
often
she
thought
and
thought
could
she
work
a
ruched
teacosy
with
embroidered
floral
design
for
him
as
a
present
or
a
clock
but
they
had
a
clock
she
noticed
on
the
mantelpiece
white
and
gold
with
a
canarybird
that
came
out
of
a
little
house
to
tell
the
time
the
day
she
went
there
about
the
flowers
for
the
forty
hours
adoration
because
it
was
hard
to
know
what
sort
of
a
present
to
give
or
perhaps
an
album
of
illuminated
views
of
dublin
or
some
place
the
exasperating
little
brats
of
twins
began
to
quarrel
again
and
jacky
threw
the
ball
out
towards
the
sea
and
they
both
ran
after
it
little
monkeys
common
as
ditchwater
someone
ought
to
take
them
and
give
them
a
good
hiding
for
themselves
to
keep
them
in
their
places
the
both
of
them
and
cissy
and
edy
shouted
after
them
to
come
back
because
they
were
afraid
the
tide
might
come
in
on
them
and
be
drowned
tommy
not
they
what
a
great
notion
they
had
so
cissy
said
it
was
the
very
last
time
she
d
ever
bring
them
out
she
jumped
up
and
called
them
and
she
ran
down
the
slope
past
him
tossing
her
hair
behind
her
which
had
a
good
enough
colour
if
there
had
been
more
of
it
but
with
all
the
thingamerry
she
was
always
rubbing
into
it
she
couldn
t
get
it
to
grow
long
because
it
wasn
t
natural
so
she
could
just
go
and
throw
her
hat
at
it
she
ran
with
long
gandery
strides
it
was
a
wonder
she
didn
t
rip
up
her
skirt
at
the
side
that
was
too
tight
on
her
because
there
was
a
lot
of
the
tomboy
about
cissy
caffrey
and
she
was
a
forward
piece
whenever
she
thought
she
had
a
good
opportunity
to
show
off
and
just
because
she
was
a
good
runner
she
ran
like
that
so
that
he
could
see
all
the
end
of
her
petticoat
running
and
her
skinny
shanks
up
as
far
as
possible
it
would
have
served
her
just
right
if
she
had
tripped
up
over
something
accidentally
on
purpose
with
her
high
crooked
french
heels
on
her
to
make
her
look
tall
and
got
a
fine
tumble
tableau
that
would
have
been
a
very
charming
exposé
for
a
gentleman
like
that
to
witness
queen
of
angels
queen
of
patriarchs
queen
of
prophets
of
all
saints
they
prayed
queen
of
the
most
holy
rosary
and
then
father
conroy
handed
the
thurible
to
canon
o
hanlon
and
he
put
in
the
incense
and
censed
the
blessed
sacrament
and
cissy
caffrey
caught
the
two
twins
and
she
was
itching
to
give
them
a
ringing
good
clip
on
the
ear
but
she
didn
t
because
she
thought
he
might
be
watching
but
she
never
made
a
bigger
mistake
in
all
her
life
because
gerty
could
see
without
looking
that
he
never
took
his
eyes
off
of
her
and
then
canon
o
hanlon
handed
the
thurible
back
to
father
conroy
and
knelt
down
looking
up
at
the
blessed
sacrament
and
the
choir
began
to
sing
the
tantum
ergo
and
she
just
swung
her
foot
in
and
out
in
time
as
the
music
rose
and
fell
to
the
tantumer
gosa
cramen
tum
three
and
eleven
she
paid
for
those
stockings
in
sparrow
s
of
george
s
street
on
the
tuesday
no
the
monday
before
easter
and
there
wasn
t
a
brack
on
them
and
that
was
what
he
was
looking
at
transparent
and
not
at
her
insignificant
ones
that
had
neither
shape
nor
form
the
cheek
of
her
because
he
had
eyes
in
his
head
to
see
the
difference
for
himself
cissy
came
up
along
the
strand
with
the
two
twins
and
their
ball
with
her
hat
anyhow
on
her
to
one
side
after
her
run
and
she
did
look
a
streel
tugging
the
two
kids
along
with
the
flimsy
blouse
she
bought
only
a
fortnight
before
like
a
rag
on
her
back
and
a
bit
of
her
petticoat
hanging
like
a
caricature
gerty
just
took
off
her
hat
for
a
moment
to
settle
her
hair
and
a
prettier
a
daintier
head
of
nutbrown
tresses
was
never
seen
on
a
girl
s
radiant
little
vision
in
sooth
almost
maddening
in
its
sweetness
you
would
have
to
travel
many
a
long
mile
before
you
found
a
head
of
hair
the
like
of
that
she
could
almost
see
the
swift
answering
flash
of
admiration
in
his
eyes
that
set
her
tingling
in
every
nerve
she
put
on
her
hat
so
that
she
could
see
from
underneath
the
brim
and
swung
her
buckled
shoe
faster
for
her
breath
caught
as
she
caught
the
expression
in
his
eyes
he
was
eying
her
as
a
snake
eyes
its
prey
her
woman
s
instinct
told
her
that
she
had
raised
the
devil
in
him
and
at
the
thought
a
burning
scarlet
swept
from
throat
to
brow
till
the
lovely
colour
of
her
face
became
a
glorious
rose
edy
boardman
was
noticing
it
too
because
she
was
squinting
at
gerty
half
smiling
with
her
specs
like
an
old
maid
pretending
to
nurse
the
baby
irritable
little
gnat
she
was
and
always
would
be
and
that
was
why
could
get
on
with
her
poking
her
nose
into
what
was
no
concern
of
hers
and
she
said
to
gerty
penny
for
your
thoughts
replied
gerty
with
a
smile
reinforced
by
the
whitest
of
teeth
i
was
only
wondering
was
it
late
because
she
wished
to
goodness
they
d
take
the
snottynosed
twins
and
their
babby
home
to
the
mischief
out
of
that
so
that
was
why
she
just
gave
a
gentle
hint
about
its
being
late
and
when
cissy
came
up
edy
asked
her
the
time
and
miss
cissy
as
glib
as
you
like
said
it
was
half
past
kissing
time
time
to
kiss
again
but
edy
wanted
to
know
because
they
were
told
to
be
in
early
said
cissy
i
ll
run
ask
my
uncle
peter
over
there
what
s
the
time
by
his
conundrum
so
over
she
went
and
when
he
saw
her
coming
she
could
see
him
take
his
hand
out
of
his
pocket
getting
nervous
and
beginning
to
play
with
his
watchchain
looking
up
at
the
church
passionate
nature
though
he
was
gerty
could
see
that
he
had
enormous
control
over
himself
one
moment
he
had
been
there
fascinated
by
a
loveliness
that
made
him
gaze
and
the
next
moment
it
was
the
quiet
gravefaced
gentleman
selfcontrol
expressed
in
every
line
of
his
distinguishedlooking
figure
cissy
said
to
excuse
her
would
he
mind
please
telling
her
what
was
the
right
time
and
gerty
could
see
him
taking
out
his
watch
listening
to
it
and
looking
up
and
clearing
his
throat
and
he
said
he
was
very
sorry
his
watch
was
stopped
but
he
thought
it
must
be
after
eight
because
the
sun
was
set
his
voice
had
a
cultured
ring
in
it
and
though
he
spoke
in
measured
accents
there
was
a
suspicion
of
a
quiver
in
the
mellow
tones
cissy
said
thanks
and
came
back
with
her
tongue
out
and
said
uncle
said
his
waterworks
were
out
of
order
then
they
sang
the
second
verse
of
the
tantum
ergo
and
canon
o
hanlon
got
up
again
and
censed
the
blessed
sacrament
and
knelt
down
and
he
told
father
conroy
that
one
of
the
candles
was
just
going
to
set
fire
to
the
flowers
and
father
conroy
got
up
and
settled
it
all
right
and
she
could
see
the
gentleman
winding
his
watch
and
listening
to
the
works
and
she
swung
her
leg
more
in
and
out
in
time
it
was
getting
darker
but
he
could
see
and
he
was
looking
all
the
time
that
he
was
winding
the
watch
or
whatever
he
was
doing
to
it
and
then
he
put
it
back
and
put
his
hands
back
into
his
pockets
she
felt
a
kind
of
a
sensation
rushing
all
over
her
and
she
knew
by
the
feel
of
her
scalp
and
that
irritation
against
her
stays
that
that
thing
must
be
coming
on
because
the
last
time
too
was
when
she
clipped
her
hair
on
account
of
the
moon
his
dark
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
her
again
drinking
in
her
every
contour
literally
worshipping
at
her
shrine
if
ever
there
was
undisguised
admiration
in
a
man
s
passionate
gaze
it
was
there
plain
to
be
seen
on
that
man
s
face
it
is
for
you
gertrude
macdowell
and
you
know
it
edy
began
to
get
ready
to
go
and
it
was
high
time
for
her
and
gerty
noticed
that
that
little
hint
she
gave
had
had
the
desired
effect
because
it
was
a
long
way
along
the
strand
to
where
there
was
the
place
to
push
up
the
pushcar
and
cissy
took
off
the
twins
caps
and
tidied
their
hair
to
make
herself
attractive
of
course
and
canon
o
hanlon
stood
up
with
his
cope
poking
up
at
his
neck
and
father
conroy
handed
him
the
card
to
read
off
and
he
read
out
panem
de
coelo
praestitisti
eis
and
edy
and
cissy
were
talking
about
the
time
all
the
time
and
asking
her
but
gerty
could
pay
them
back
in
their
own
coin
and
she
just
answered
with
scathing
politeness
when
edy
asked
her
was
she
heartbroken
about
her
best
boy
throwing
her
over
gerty
winced
sharply
a
brief
cold
blaze
shone
from
her
eyes
that
spoke
volumes
of
scorn
immeasurable
it
yes
it
cut
deep
because
edy
had
her
own
quiet
way
of
saying
things
like
that
she
knew
would
wound
like
the
confounded
little
cat
she
was
gerty
s
lips
parted
swiftly
to
frame
the
word
but
she
fought
back
the
sob
that
rose
to
her
throat
so
slim
so
flawless
so
beautifully
moulded
it
seemed
one
an
artist
might
have
dreamed
of
she
had
loved
him
better
than
he
knew
lighthearted
deceiver
and
fickle
like
all
his
sex
he
would
never
understand
what
he
had
meant
to
her
and
for
an
instant
there
was
in
the
blue
eyes
a
quick
stinging
of
tears
their
eyes
were
probing
her
mercilessly
but
with
a
brave
effort
she
sparkled
back
in
sympathy
as
she
glanced
at
her
new
conquest
for
them
to
see
responded
gerty
quick
as
lightning
laughing
and
the
proud
head
flashed
up
i
can
throw
my
cap
at
who
i
like
because
it
s
leap
year
her
words
rang
out
crystalclear
more
musical
than
the
cooing
of
the
ringdove
but
they
cut
the
silence
icily
there
was
that
in
her
young
voice
that
told
that
she
was
not
a
one
to
be
lightly
trifled
with
as
for
mr
reggy
with
his
swank
and
his
bit
of
money
she
could
just
chuck
him
aside
as
if
he
was
so
much
filth
and
never
again
would
she
cast
as
much
as
a
second
thought
on
him
and
tear
his
silly
postcard
into
a
dozen
pieces
and
if
ever
after
he
dared
to
presume
she
could
give
him
one
look
of
measured
scorn
that
would
make
him
shrivel
up
on
the
spot
miss
puny
little
edy
s
countenance
fell
to
no
slight
extent
and
gerty
could
see
by
her
looking
as
black
as
thunder
that
she
was
simply
in
a
towering
rage
though
she
hid
it
the
little
kinnatt
because
that
shaft
had
struck
home
for
her
petty
jealousy
and
they
both
knew
that
she
was
something
aloof
apart
in
another
sphere
that
she
was
not
of
them
and
never
would
be
and
there
was
somebody
else
too
that
knew
it
and
saw
it
so
they
could
put
that
in
their
pipe
and
smoke
it
edy
straightened
up
baby
boardman
to
get
ready
to
go
and
cissy
tucked
in
the
ball
and
the
spades
and
buckets
and
it
was
high
time
too
because
the
sandman
was
on
his
way
for
master
boardman
junior
and
cissy
told
him
too
that
billy
winks
was
coming
and
that
baby
was
to
go
deedaw
and
baby
looked
just
too
ducky
laughing
up
out
of
his
gleeful
eyes
and
cissy
poked
him
like
that
out
of
fun
in
his
wee
fat
tummy
and
baby
without
as
much
as
by
your
leave
sent
up
his
compliments
to
all
and
sundry
on
to
his
brandnew
dribbling
bib
my
puddeny
pie
protested
ciss
he
has
his
bib
destroyed
the
slight
contretemps
claimed
her
attention
but
in
two
twos
she
set
that
little
matter
to
rights
gerty
stifled
a
smothered
exclamation
and
gave
a
nervous
cough
and
edy
asked
what
and
she
was
just
going
to
tell
her
to
catch
it
while
it
was
flying
but
she
was
ever
ladylike
in
her
deportment
so
she
simply
passed
it
off
with
consummate
tact
by
saying
that
that
was
the
benediction
because
just
then
the
bell
rang
out
from
the
steeple
over
the
quiet
seashore
because
canon
o
hanlon
was
up
on
the
altar
with
the
veil
that
father
conroy
put
round
his
shoulders
giving
the
benediction
with
the
blessed
sacrament
in
his
hands
how
moving
the
scene
there
in
the
gathering
twilight
the
last
glimpse
of
erin
the
touching
chime
of
those
evening
bells
and
at
the
same
time
a
bat
flew
forth
from
the
ivied
belfry
through
the
dusk
hither
thither
with
a
tiny
lost
cry
and
she
could
see
far
away
the
lights
of
the
lighthouses
so
picturesque
she
would
have
loved
to
do
with
a
box
of
paints
because
it
was
easier
than
to
make
a
man
and
soon
the
lamplighter
would
be
going
his
rounds
past
the
presbyterian
church
grounds
and
along
by
shady
tritonville
avenue
where
the
couples
walked
and
lighting
the
lamp
near
her
window
where
reggy
wylie
used
to
turn
his
freewheel
like
she
read
in
that
book
the
lamplighter
by
miss
cummins
author
of
mabel
vaughan
and
other
tales
for
gerty
had
her
dreams
that
knew
of
she
loved
to
read
poetry
and
when
she
got
a
keepsake
from
bertha
supple
of
that
lovely
confession
album
with
the
coralpink
cover
to
write
her
thoughts
in
she
laid
it
in
the
drawer
of
her
toilettable
which
though
it
did
not
err
on
the
side
of
luxury
was
scrupulously
neat
and
clean
it
was
there
she
kept
her
girlish
treasure
trove
the
tortoiseshell
combs
her
child
of
mary
badge
the
whiterose
scent
the
eyebrowleine
her
alabaster
pouncetbox
and
the
ribbons
to
change
when
her
things
came
home
from
the
wash
and
there
were
some
beautiful
thoughts
written
in
it
in
violet
ink
that
she
bought
in
hely
s
of
dame
street
for
she
felt
that
she
too
could
write
poetry
if
she
could
only
express
herself
like
that
poem
that
appealed
to
her
so
deeply
that
she
had
copied
out
of
the
newspaper
she
found
one
evening
round
the
potherbs
art
thou
real
my
ideal
it
was
called
by
louis
j
walsh
magherafelt
and
after
there
was
something
about
twilight
wilt
thou
ever
and
ofttimes
the
beauty
of
poetry
so
sad
in
its
transient
loveliness
had
misted
her
eyes
with
silent
tears
for
she
felt
that
the
years
were
slipping
by
for
her
one
by
one
and
but
for
that
one
shortcoming
she
knew
she
need
fear
no
competition
and
that
was
an
accident
coming
down
dalkey
hill
and
she
always
tried
to
conceal
it
but
it
must
end
she
felt
if
she
saw
that
magic
lure
in
his
eyes
there
would
be
no
holding
back
for
her
love
laughs
at
locksmiths
she
would
make
the
great
sacrifice
her
every
effort
would
be
to
share
his
thoughts
dearer
than
the
whole
world
would
she
be
to
him
and
gild
his
days
with
happiness
there
was
the
allimportant
question
and
she
was
dying
to
know
was
he
a
married
man
or
a
widower
who
had
lost
his
wife
or
some
tragedy
like
the
nobleman
with
the
foreign
name
from
the
land
of
song
had
to
have
her
put
into
a
madhouse
cruel
only
to
be
kind
but
even
then
would
it
make
a
very
great
difference
from
everything
in
the
least
indelicate
her
finebred
nature
instinctively
recoiled
she
loathed
that
sort
of
person
the
fallen
women
off
the
accommodation
walk
beside
the
dodder
that
went
with
the
soldiers
and
coarse
men
with
no
respect
for
a
girl
s
honour
degrading
the
sex
and
being
taken
up
to
the
police
station
no
no
not
that
they
would
be
just
good
friends
like
a
big
brother
and
sister
without
all
that
other
in
spite
of
the
conventions
of
society
with
a
big
ess
perhaps
it
was
an
old
flame
he
was
in
mourning
for
from
the
days
beyond
recall
she
thought
she
understood
she
would
try
to
understand
him
because
men
were
so
different
the
old
love
was
waiting
waiting
with
little
white
hands
stretched
out
with
blue
appealing
eyes
heart
of
mine
she
would
follow
her
dream
of
love
the
dictates
of
her
heart
that
told
her
he
was
her
all
in
all
the
only
man
in
all
the
world
for
her
for
love
was
the
master
guide
nothing
else
mattered
come
what
might
she
would
be
wild
untrammelled
free
canon
o
hanlon
put
the
blessed
sacrament
back
into
the
tabernacle
and
genuflected
and
the
choir
sang
laudate
dominum
omnes
gentes
and
then
he
locked
the
tabernacle
door
because
the
benediction
was
over
and
father
conroy
handed
him
his
hat
to
put
on
and
crosscat
edy
asked
wasn
t
she
coming
but
jacky
caffrey
called
out
look
cissy
and
they
all
looked
was
it
sheet
lightning
but
tommy
saw
it
too
over
the
trees
beside
the
church
blue
and
then
green
and
purple
s
fireworks
cissy
caffrey
said
and
they
all
ran
down
the
strand
to
see
over
the
houses
and
the
church
helterskelter
edy
with
the
pushcar
with
baby
boardman
in
it
and
cissy
holding
tommy
and
jacky
by
the
hand
so
they
wouldn
t
fall
running
on
gerty
cissy
called
it
s
the
bazaar
fireworks
but
gerty
was
adamant
she
had
no
intention
of
being
at
their
beck
and
call
if
they
could
run
like
rossies
she
could
sit
so
she
said
she
could
see
from
where
she
was
the
eyes
that
were
fastened
upon
her
set
her
pulses
tingling
she
looked
at
him
a
moment
meeting
his
glance
and
a
light
broke
in
upon
her
whitehot
passion
was
in
that
face
passion
silent
as
the
grave
and
it
had
made
her
his
at
last
they
were
left
alone
without
the
others
to
pry
and
pass
remarks
and
she
knew
he
could
be
trusted
to
the
death
steadfast
a
sterling
man
a
man
of
inflexible
honour
to
his
fingertips
his
hands
and
face
were
working
and
a
tremour
went
over
her
she
leaned
back
far
to
look
up
where
the
fireworks
were
and
she
caught
her
knee
in
her
hands
so
as
not
to
fall
back
looking
up
and
there
was
to
see
only
him
and
her
when
she
revealed
all
her
graceful
beautifully
shaped
legs
like
that
supply
soft
and
delicately
rounded
and
she
seemed
to
hear
the
panting
of
his
heart
his
hoarse
breathing
because
she
knew
too
about
the
passion
of
men
like
that
hotblooded
because
bertha
supple
told
her
once
in
dead
secret
and
made
her
swear
she
d
never
about
the
gentleman
lodger
that
was
staying
with
them
out
of
the
congested
districts
board
that
had
pictures
cut
out
of
papers
of
those
skirtdancers
and
highkickers
and
she
said
he
used
to
do
something
not
very
nice
that
you
could
imagine
sometimes
in
the
bed
but
this
was
altogether
different
from
a
thing
like
that
because
there
was
all
the
difference
because
she
could
almost
feel
him
draw
her
face
to
his
and
the
first
quick
hot
touch
of
his
handsome
lips
besides
there
was
absolution
so
long
as
you
didn
t
do
the
other
thing
before
being
married
and
there
ought
to
be
women
priests
that
would
understand
without
your
telling
out
and
cissy
caffrey
too
sometimes
had
that
dreamy
kind
of
dreamy
look
in
her
eyes
so
that
she
too
my
dear
and
winny
rippingham
so
mad
about
actors
photographs
and
besides
it
was
on
account
of
that
other
thing
coming
on
the
way
it
did
and
jacky
caffrey
shouted
to
look
there
was
another
and
she
leaned
back
and
the
garters
were
blue
to
match
on
account
of
the
transparent
and
they
all
saw
it
and
they
all
shouted
to
look
look
there
it
was
and
she
leaned
back
ever
so
far
to
see
the
fireworks
and
something
queer
was
flying
through
the
air
a
soft
thing
to
and
fro
dark
and
she
saw
a
long
roman
candle
going
up
over
the
trees
up
up
and
in
the
tense
hush
they
were
all
breathless
with
excitement
as
it
went
higher
and
higher
and
she
had
to
lean
back
more
and
more
to
look
up
after
it
high
high
almost
out
of
sight
and
her
face
was
suffused
with
a
divine
an
entrancing
blush
from
straining
back
and
he
could
see
her
other
things
too
nainsook
knickers
the
fabric
that
caresses
the
skin
better
than
those
other
pettiwidth
the
green
four
and
eleven
on
account
of
being
white
and
she
let
him
and
she
saw
that
he
saw
and
then
it
went
so
high
it
went
out
of
sight
a
moment
and
she
was
trembling
in
every
limb
from
being
bent
so
far
back
that
he
had
a
full
view
high
up
above
her
knee
where
ever
not
even
on
the
swing
or
wading
and
she
wasn
t
ashamed
and
he
wasn
t
either
to
look
in
that
immodest
way
like
that
because
he
couldn
t
resist
the
sight
of
the
wondrous
revealment
half
offered
like
those
skirtdancers
behaving
so
immodest
before
gentlemen
looking
and
he
kept
on
looking
looking
she
would
fain
have
cried
to
him
chokingly
held
out
her
snowy
slender
arms
to
him
to
come
to
feel
his
lips
laid
on
her
white
brow
the
cry
of
a
young
girl
s
love
a
little
strangled
cry
wrung
from
her
that
cry
that
has
rung
through
the
ages
and
then
a
rocket
sprang
and
bang
shot
blind
blank
and
o
then
the
roman
candle
burst
and
it
was
like
a
sigh
of
o
and
everyone
cried
o
o
in
raptures
and
it
gushed
out
of
it
a
stream
of
rain
gold
hair
threads
and
they
shed
and
ah
they
were
all
greeny
dewy
stars
falling
with
golden
o
so
lovely
o
soft
sweet
soft
then
all
melted
away
dewily
in
the
grey
air
all
was
silent
ah
she
glanced
at
him
as
she
bent
forward
quickly
a
pathetic
little
glance
of
piteous
protest
of
shy
reproach
under
which
he
coloured
like
a
girl
he
was
leaning
back
against
the
rock
behind
leopold
bloom
for
it
is
he
stands
silent
with
bowed
head
before
those
young
guileless
eyes
what
a
brute
he
had
been
at
it
again
a
fair
unsullied
soul
had
called
to
him
and
wretch
that
he
was
how
had
he
answered
an
utter
cad
he
had
been
he
of
all
men
but
there
was
an
infinite
store
of
mercy
in
those
eyes
for
him
too
a
word
of
pardon
even
though
he
had
erred
and
sinned
and
wandered
should
a
girl
tell
no
a
thousand
times
no
that
was
their
secret
only
theirs
alone
in
the
hiding
twilight
and
there
was
none
to
know
or
tell
save
the
little
bat
that
flew
so
softly
through
the
evening
to
and
fro
and
little
bats
don
t
tell
cissy
caffrey
whistled
imitating
the
boys
in
the
football
field
to
show
what
a
great
person
she
was
and
then
she
cried
gerty
we
re
going
come
on
we
can
see
from
farther
up
gerty
had
an
idea
one
of
love
s
little
ruses
she
slipped
a
hand
into
her
kerchief
pocket
and
took
out
the
wadding
and
waved
in
reply
of
course
without
letting
him
and
then
slipped
it
back
wonder
if
he
s
too
far
to
she
rose
was
it
goodbye
no
she
had
to
go
but
they
would
meet
again
there
and
she
would
dream
of
that
till
then
tomorrow
of
her
dream
of
yester
eve
she
drew
herself
up
to
her
full
height
their
souls
met
in
a
last
lingering
glance
and
the
eyes
that
reached
her
heart
full
of
a
strange
shining
hung
enraptured
on
her
sweet
flowerlike
face
she
half
smiled
at
him
wanly
a
sweet
forgiving
smile
a
smile
that
verged
on
tears
and
then
they
parted
slowly
without
looking
back
she
went
down
the
uneven
strand
to
cissy
to
edy
to
jacky
and
tommy
caffrey
to
little
baby
boardman
it
was
darker
now
and
there
were
stones
and
bits
of
wood
on
the
strand
and
slippy
seaweed
she
walked
with
a
certain
quiet
dignity
characteristic
of
her
but
with
care
and
very
slowly
gerty
macdowell
was
tight
boots
no
she
s
lame
o
mr
bloom
watched
her
as
she
limped
away
poor
girl
that
s
why
she
s
left
on
the
shelf
and
the
others
did
a
sprint
thought
something
was
wrong
by
the
cut
of
her
jib
jilted
beauty
a
defect
is
ten
times
worse
in
a
woman
but
makes
them
polite
glad
i
didn

know
it
when
she
was
on
show

devil
all
the

there
behind

however
if

how
to
end
the
conversation
ask
them
a
question
they
ask
you
another

if

but
then
you

wonderful
of

the

evening
in

in

that
night
all
the
dirty
things
i
made
her
say
all
wrong
of
course
my
arks
she
called
it
it
s
so
hard
to
find
one
who
aho
if
you
don
t
answer
when
they
solicit
must
be
horrible
for
them
till
they
harden
and
kissed
my
hand
when
i
gave
her
the
extra
two
shillings
parrots
press
the
button
and
the
bird
will
squeak
wish
she
hadn
t
called
me
sir
o
her
mouth
in
the
dark
and
you
a
married
man
with
a
single
girl
that
s
what
they
enjoy
taking
a
man
from
another
woman
or
even
hear
of
it
different
with
me
glad
to
get
away
from
other
chap

his
cold

chap
in
the
burton
today
spitting

gumchewed
gristle
french
letter
still
in
my
pocketbook
cause
of
half
the
trouble
but
might
happen
sometime
i
don
t
think
come
in
all
is
prepared
i
dreamt
what
worst
is
beginning
how
they
change
the
venue
when
it
s
not
what
they
like
ask
you
do
you
like
mushrooms
because
she
once
knew
a
gentleman
who
or
ask
you
what
someone
was
going
to
say
when
he
changed
his
mind
and
stopped
yet
if
i
went
the
whole
hog
say
i
want
to
something
like
that
because
i
did
she
too
offend
her
then
make
it
up
pretend
to
want
something
awfully
then
cry
off
for
her
sake
flatters
them
she
must
have
been
thinking
of
someone
else
all
the
time
what
harm
must
since
she
came
to
the
use
of
reason
he
he
and
he
first
kiss
does
the
trick
the
propitious
moment
something
inside
them
goes
pop
mushy
like
tell
by
their
eye
on
the
sly
first
thoughts
are
best
remember
that
till
their
dying
day
molly
lieutenant
mulvey
that
kissed
her
under
the
moorish
wall
beside
the
gardens
fifteen
she
told
me
but
her
breasts
were
developed
fell
asleep
then
after
glencree
dinner
that
was
when
we
drove
home

gnashing
her
teeth
in
sleep
lord

his

on
her
too
val

apoplectic
there
she
is
with
them
down
there
for
the
fireworks
my
fireworks
up
like
a
rocket
down
like
a
stick
and
the
children

they
must
be
waiting
for
something
to
happen
want
to
be
grownups
dressing
in

all
the

under

bed
for
what

not
there
longing
to
get
the
fright
of
their
lives
sharp
as
needles
they
are
when
i
said
to
molly
the
man
at
the
corner
of
cuffe
street
was
goodlooking
thought
she
might
like
twigged
at
once
he

when

i
never
told
her
neat
way

too
attract
men
small
thing
like
that
holding
up
her
hand
shaking
it
to
let
the
blood
flow
back
when
it
was
red
who
did
you
learn
that
from
nobody
something
the
nurse
taught
me
o
don
t
they
know
three
years
old
she
was
in
front
of
molly
s
dressingtable
just
before
we
left
lombard
street
west
me
have
a
nice
pace
mullingar
who
knows
ways
of
the
world
young
student
straight
on
her
pins
anyway
not
like
the
other
still
she
was
game
lord
i
am
wet
devil
you
are
swell
of
her
calf
transparent
stockings
stretched
to
breaking
point
not
like
that
frump
today
rumpled
stockings
or
the
one
in
grafton
street
white
wow
beef
to
the

a
monkey

burst
spluttering
in
darting

zrads
and
cissy
and
tommy
and
jacky
ran
out
to
see
and
edy
after
with
the
pushcar
and
then
gerty
beyond
the
curve
of
the
rocks
will
she
watch
watch
see
looked
round
she
smelt
an
onion
darling
i
saw
your
i
saw
all
lord
did
me
good
all
the
same
off
colour
after
kiernan
s
dignam
s
for
this
relief
much
thanks
in
hamlet
that
is
lord
it
was
all
things
combined
excitement
when
she
leaned
back
felt
an
ache
at
the
butt
of
my
tongue
your
head
it
simply
swirls
he
s
right
might
have
made
a
worse
fool
of
myself
however
instead
of
talking
about
nothing
then
i
will
tell
you
all
still
it
was
a
kind
of
language
between
us
it
couldn
t
be
no
gerty
they
called
her
might
be
false
name
however
like
my
name
and
the
address
dolphin
s
barn
a
blind
her
maiden
name
was
jemina
brown
and
she
lived
with
her
mother
in
irishtown
place
made
me
think
of
that
i
suppose
all
tarred
with
the
same
brush
wiping
pens
in
their
stockings
but
the
ball
rolled
down
to
her
as
if
it
understood
every
bullet
has
its
billet
course
i
never
could
throw
anything
straight
at
school
crooked
as
a
ram
s
horn
sad
however
because
it
lasts
only
a
few
years
till
they
settle
down
to
potwalloping
and
papa
s
pants
will
soon
fit
willy
and
fuller
s
earth
for
the
baby
when
they
hold
him
out
to
do
ah
ah
no
soft
job
saves
them
keeps
them
out
of

always
round
them
cocoanut
skulls

not
even
closed
at

to

an

it

mrs
beaufoy
purefoy
must
call
to
the
hospital
wonder
is
nurse
callan
there
still
she
used
to
look
over
some
nights
when
molly
was
in
the
coffee
palace
that
young
doctor
o
hare
i
noticed
her
brushing
his
coat
and
mrs
breen
and
mrs
dignam
once
like
that
too
marriageable
worst
of
all
at
night
mrs
duggan
told
me
in
the
city
arms
husband
rolling
in
drunk
stink
of
pub
off
him
like
a
polecat
have
that
in
your
nose
in
the
dark
whiff
of
stale
boose
then
ask
in
the
morning
was
i
drunk
last
night
bad
policy
however
to
fault
the
husband
chickens
come
home
to
roost
they
stick
by
one
another
like
glue
maybe
the
women
s
fault
also
that
s
where
molly
can
knock
spots
off
them
it
s
the
blood
of
the
south
moorish
also
the
form
the
figure
hands
felt
for
the
opulent
just
compare
for
instance
those
others
wife
locked
up
at
home
skeleton
in
the
cupboard
allow
me
to
introduce
my
then
they
trot
you
out
some
kind
of
a
nondescript
wouldn
t
know
what
to
call
her
always
see
a
fellow
s
weak
point
in
his
wife
still
there
s
destiny
in
it
falling
in
love
have
their
own
secrets
between
them
chaps
that
would
go
to
the
dogs
if
some
woman
didn
t
take
them
in
hand
then
little
chits
of
girls
height
of
a
shilling
in
coppers
with
little
hubbies
as
god
made
them
he
matched
them
sometimes
children
turn
out
well
enough
twice
nought
makes
one
or
old
rich
chap
of
seventy
and
blushing
bride
marry
in
may
and
repent
in
december
this
wet
is
very
unpleasant
stuck
well
the
foreskin
is
not
back
better
detach
ow
other
hand
a
sixfooter
with
a
wifey
up
to
his
watchpocket
long
and
the
short
of
it
big
he
and
little
she
very
strange
about
my
watch
wristwatches
are
always
going
wrong
wonder
is
there
any
magnetic
influence
between
the
person
because
that
was
about
the
time
he
yes
i
suppose
at
once
cat
s
away
the
mice
will
play
i
remember
looking
in
pill
lane
also
that
now
is
magnetism
back
of
everything
magnetism
earth
for
instance
pulling
this
and
being
pulled
that
causes
movement
and
time
well
that
s
the
time
the
movement
takes
then
if
one
thing
stopped
the
whole
ghesabo
would
stop
bit
by
bit
because
it
s
all
arranged
magnetic
needle
tells
you
what
s
going
on
in
the
sun
the
stars
little
piece
of
steel
iron
when
you
hold
out
the
fork
come
come
tip
woman
and
man
that
is
fork
and
steel
molly
he
dress
up
and
look
and
suggest
and
let
you
see
and
see
more
and
defy
you
if
you
re
a
man
to
see
that
and
like
a
sneeze
coming
legs
look
look
and
if
you
have
any
guts
in
you
tip
have
to
let
fly
wonder
how
is
she
feeling
in
that
region
shame
all
put
on
before
third
person
more
put
out
about
a
hole
in
her
stocking
molly
her
underjaw
stuck
out
head
back
about
the
farmer
in
the
ridingboots
and
spurs
at
the
horse
show
and
when
the
painters
were
in
lombard
street
west
fine
voice
that
fellow
had
how
giuglini
began
smell
that
i
did
like
flowers
it
was
too
violets
came
from
the
turpentine
probably
in
the
paint
make
their
own
use
of
everything
same
time
doing
it
scraped
her
slipper
on
the
floor
so
they
wouldn
t
hear
but
lots
of
them
can
t
kick
the
beam
i
think
keep
that
thing
up
for
hours
kind
of
a
general
all
round
over
me
and
half
down
my
back
wait
hm
hm
yes
that
s
her
perfume
why
she
waved
her
hand
i
leave
you
this
to
think
of
me
when
i
m
far
away
on
the
pillow
what
is
it
heliotrope
no
hyacinth
hm
roses
i
think
she
d
like
scent
of
that
kind
sweet
and
cheap
soon
sour
why
molly
likes
opoponax
suits
her
with
a
little
jessamine
mixed
her
high
notes
and
her
low
notes
at
the
dance
night
she
met
him
dance
of
the
hours
heat
brought
it
out
she
was
wearing
her
black
and
it
had
the
perfume
of
the
time
before
good
conductor
is
it
or
bad
light
too
suppose
there
s
some
connection
for
instance
if
you
go
into
a
cellar
where
it
s
dark
mysterious
thing
too
why
did
i
smell
it
only
now
took
its
time
in
coming
like
herself
slow
but
sure
suppose
it
s
ever
so
many
millions
of
tiny
grains
blown
across
yes
it
is
because
those
spice
islands
cinghalese
this
morning
smell
them
leagues
off
tell
you
what
it
is
it
s
like
a
fine
fine
veil
or
web
they
have
all
over
the
skin
fine
like
what
do
you
call
it
gossamer
and
they
re
always
spinning
it
out
of
them
fine
as
anything
like
rainbow
colours
without
knowing
it
clings
to
everything
she
takes
off
vamp
of
her
stockings
warm
shoe
stays
drawers
little
kick
taking
them
off
byby
till
next
time
also
the
cat
likes
to
sniff
in
her
shift
on
the
bed
know
her
smell
in
a
thousand
bathwater
too
reminds
me
of
strawberries
and
cream
wonder
where
it
is
really
there
or
the
armpits
or
under
the
neck
because
you
get
it
out
of
all
holes
and
corners
hyacinth
perfume
made
of
oil
of
ether
or
something
muskrat
bag
under
their
tails
one
grain
pour
off
odour
for
years
dogs
at
each
other
behind
good
evening
evening
how
do
you
sniff
hm
hm
very
well
thank
you
animals
go
by
that
yes
now
look
at
it
that
way
we
re
the
same
some
women
instance
warn
you
off
when
they
have
their
period
come
near
then
get
a
hogo
you
could
hang
your
hat
on
like
what
potted
herrings
gone
stale
or
boof
please
keep
off
the
grass
perhaps
they
get
a
man
smell
off
us
what
though
cigary
gloves
long
john
had
on
his
desk
the
other
day
breath
what
you
eat
and
drink
gives
that
no
mansmell
i
mean
must
be
connected
with
that
because
priests
that
are
supposed
to
be
are
different
women
buzz
round
it
like
flies
round
treacle
railed
off
the
altar
get
on
to
it
at
any
cost
the
tree
of
forbidden
priest
o
father
will
you
let
me
be
the
first
to
that
diffuses
itself
all
through
the
body
permeates
source
of
life
and
it
s
extremely
curious
the
smell
celery
sauce
let
me
mr
bloom
inserted
his
nose
hm
into
the
hm
opening
of
his
waistcoat
almonds
or
no
lemons
it
is
ah
no
that
s
the
soap
o
by
the
by
that
lotion
i
knew
there
was
something
on
my
mind
never
went
back
and
the
soap
not
paid
dislike
carrying
bottles
like
that
hag
this
morning
hynes
might
have
paid
me
that
three
shillings
i
could
mention
meagher
s
just
to
remind
him
still

very
little
perceptive
concerning

by

with

who

the

by

constantly
maintain
when
by

they
affirm

being

by

is
the
prosperity
of
a

more
efficaciously
asserted
than
by
the

of
how

the
tribute
of
its
solicitude
for
that

which

the

when

constitutes
the
certain
sign
of
omnipollent

incorrupted

for
who

there
who
anything
of
some
significance
has
apprehended
but
is
conscious
that
that

may
be
the

on

anyone

is
there
unilluminated
as
not
to

that
as
no

contend
against
the
bounty
of

so
it
behoves
every
most
just
citizen
to
become
the
exhortator
and
admonisher
of
his
semblables
and
to
tremble
lest
what
had
in
the
past
been
by
the
nation
excellently
commenced
might
be
in
the
future
not
with
similar
excellence
accomplished
if
an
inverecund
habit
shall
have
gradually
traduced
the
honourable
by
ancestors
transmitted
customs
to
that
thither
of
profundity
that
that
one
was
audacious
excessively
who
would
have
the
hardihood
to
rise
affirming
that
no
more
odious
offence
can
for
anyone
be
than
to
oblivious
neglect
to
consign
that
evangel
simultaneously
command
and
promise
which
on
all

with
prophecy
of
abundance
or
with
diminution
s
menace
that
exalted
of
reiteratedly
procreating
function
ever
irrevocably
enjoined
it
is
not
why
therefore
we
shall
wonder
if
as
the
best
historians
relate
among
the
celts
who
nothing
that
was
not
in
its
nature
admirable
admired
the
art
of

shall
have

their
greatest

sedulously

by
which
the

whether
the

had
been
the
trembling

flux
certainly
in
every
public
work
which
in
it
anything
of
gravity
contains
preparation
should
be
with
importance
commensurate
and
therefore
a
plan
was
by
them
adopted
whether
by
having
preconsidered
or
as
the
maturation
of
experience
it
is
difficult
in
being
said
which
the
discrepant
opinions
of

are
not
up

the

congrued
to

manifest
whereby

was
so

that
is
thy

and
the
dust
that
gripeth
on
every
man
that
is
born
of
woman
for
as
he
came
naked
forth
from
his
mother
s
womb
so
naked
shall
he
wend
him
at
the
last
for
to
go
as
he
came
the
man
that
was
come
in
to
the
house
then
spoke
to
the
nursingwoman
and
he
asked
her
how
it
fared
with
the
woman
that
lay
there
in
childbed
the
nursingwoman
answered
him
and
said
that
that
woman
was
in
throes
now
full
three
days
and
that
it
would
be
a
hard
birth
unneth
to
bear
but
that
now
in
a
little
it
would
be
she
said
thereto
that
she
had
seen
many
births
of
women
but
never
was
none
so
hard
as
was
that
woman
s
birth
then
she
set
it
all
forth
to
him
for
because
she
knew
the
man
that
time
was
had
lived
nigh
that
house
the
man
hearkened
to
her
words
for
he
felt
with
wonder
women
s
woe
in
the
travail
that
they
have
of
motherhood
and
he
wondered
to
look
on
her
face
that
was
a
fair
face
for
any
man
to
see
but
yet
was
she
left
after
long
years
a
handmaid
nine
twelve
bloodflows
chiding
her
childless
and
whiles
they
spake
the
door
of
the
castle
was
opened
and
there
nighed
them
a
mickle
noise
as
of
many
that
sat
there
at
meat
and
there
came
against
the
place
as
they
stood
a
young
learningknight
yclept
dixon
and
the
traveller
leopold
was
couth
to
him
sithen
it
had
happed
that
they
had
had
ado
each
with
other
in
the
house
of
misericord
where
this
learningknight
lay
by
cause
the
traveller
leopold
came
there
to
be
healed
for
he
was
sore
wounded
in
his
breast
by
a
spear
wherewith
a
horrible
and
dreadful
dragon
was
smitten
him
for
which
he
did
do
make
a
salve
of
volatile
salt
and
chrism
as
much
as
he
might
suffice
and
he
said
now
that
he
should
go
in
to
that
castle
for
to
make
merry
with
them
that
were
there
and
the
traveller
leopold
said
that
he
should
go
otherwhither
for
he
was
a
man
of
cautels
and
a
subtile
also
the
lady
was
of
his
avis
and
repreved
the
learningknight
though
she
trowed
well
that
the
traveller
had
said
thing
that
was
false
for
his
subtility
but
the
learningknight
would
not
hear
say
nay
nor
do
her
mandement
ne
have
him
in
aught
contrarious
to
his
list
and
he
said
how
it
was
a
marvellous
castle
and
the
traveller
leopold
went
into
the
castle
for
to
rest
him
for
a
space
being
sore
of
limb
after
many
marches
environing
in
divers
lands
and
sometime
venery
and
in
the
castle
was
set
a
board
that
was
of
the
birchwood
of
finlandy
and
it
was
upheld
by
four
dwarfmen
of
that
country
but
they
durst
not
move
more
for
enchantment
and
on
this
board
were
frightful
swords
and
knives
that
are
made
in
a
great
cavern
by
swinking
demons
out
of
white
flames
that
they
fix
then
in
the
horns
of
buffalos
and
stags
that
there
abound
marvellously
and
there
were
vessels
that
are
wrought
by
magic
of
mahound
out
of
seasand
and
the
air
by
a
warlock
with
his
breath
that
he
blases
in
to
them
like
to
bubbles
and
full
fair
cheer
and
rich
was
on
the
board
that
no
wight
could
devise
a
fuller
ne
richer
and
there
was
a
vat
of
silver
that
was
moved
by
craft
to
open
in
the
which
lay
strange
fishes
withouten
heads
though
misbelieving
men
nie
that
this
be
possible
thing
without
they
see
it
natheless
they
are
so
and
these
fishes
lie
in
an
oily
water
brought
there
from
portugal
land
because
of
the
fatness
that
therein
is
like
to
the
juices
of
the
olivepress
and
also
it
was
a
marvel
to
see
in
that
castle
how
by
magic
they
make
a
compost
out
of
fecund
wheatkidneys
out
of
chaldee
that
by
aid
of
certain
angry
spirits
that
they
do
in
to
it
swells
up
wondrously
like
to
a
vast
mountain
and
they
teach
the
serpents
there
to
entwine
themselves
up
on
long
sticks
out
of
the
ground
and
of
the
scales
of
these
serpents
they
brew
out
a
brewage
like
to
mead
and
the
learning
knight
let
pour
for
childe
leopold
a
draught
and
halp
thereto
the
while
all
they
that
were
there
drank
every
each
and
childe
leopold
did
up
his
beaver
for
to
pleasure
him
and
took
apertly
somewhat
in
amity
for
he
never
drank
no
manner
of
mead
which
he
then
put
by
and
anon
full
privily
he
voided
the
more
part
in
his
neighbour
glass
and
his
neighbour
nist
not
of
this
wile
and
he
sat
down
in
that
castle
with
them
for
to
rest
him
there
awhile
thanked
be
almighty
god
this
meanwhile
this
good
sister
stood
by
the
door
and
begged
them
at
the
reverence
of
jesu
our
alther
liege
lord
to
leave
their
wassailing
for
there
was
above
one
quick
with
child
a
gentle
dame
whose
time
hied
fast
sir
leopold
heard
on
the
upfloor
cry
on
high
and
he
wondered
what
cry
that
it
was
whether
of
child
or
woman
and
i
marvel
said
he
that
it
be
not
come
or
now
meseems
it
dureth
overlong
and
he
was
ware
and
saw
a
franklin
that
hight
lenehan
on
that
side
the
table
that
was
older
than
any
of
the
tother
and
for
that
they
both
were
knights
virtuous
in
the
one
emprise
and
eke
by
cause
that
he
was
elder
he
spoke
to
him
full
gently
but
said
he
or
it
be
long
too
she
will
bring
forth
by
god
his
bounty
and
have
joy
of
her
childing
for
she
hath
waited
marvellous
long
and
the
franklin
that
had
drunken
said
expecting
each
moment
to
be
her
next
also
he
took
the
cup
that
stood
tofore
him
for
him
needed
never
none
asking
nor
desiring
of
him
to
drink
and
now
drink
said
he
fully
delectably
and
he
quaffed
as
far
as
he
might
to
their
both
s
health
for
he
was
a
passing
good
man
of
his
lustiness
and
sir
leopold
that
was
the
goodliest
guest
that
ever
sat
in
scholars
hall
and
that
was
the
meekest
man
and
the
kindest
that
ever
laid
husbandly
hand
under
hen
and
that
was
the
very
truest
knight
of
the
world
one
that
ever
did
minion
service
to
lady
gentle
pledged
him
courtly
in
the
cup
woman
s
woe
with
wonder
pondering
now
let
us
speak
of
that
fellowship
that
was
there
to
the
intent
to
be
drunken
an
they
might
there
was
a
sort
of
scholars
along
either
side
the
board
that
is
to
wit
dixon
yclept
junior
of
saint
mary
merciable
s
with
other
his
fellows
lynch
and
madden
scholars
of
medicine
and
the
franklin
that
hight
lenehan
and
one
from
alba
longa
one
crotthers
and
young
stephen
that
had
mien
of
a
frere
that
was
at
head
of
the
board
and
costello
that
men
clepen
punch
costello
all
long
of
a
mastery
of
him
erewhile
gested
and
of
all
them
reserved
young
stephen
he
was
the
most
drunken
that
demanded
still
of
more
mead
and
beside
the
meek
sir
leopold
but
on
young
malachi
they
waited
for
that
he
promised
to
have
come
and
such
as
intended
to
no
goodness
said
how
he
had
broke
his
avow
and
sir
leopold
sat
with
them
for
he
bore
fast
friendship
to
sir
simon
and
to
this
his
son
young
stephen
and
for
that
his
languor
becalmed
him
there
after
longest
wanderings
insomuch
as
they
feasted
him
for
that
time
in
the
honourablest
manner
ruth
red
him
love
led
on
with
will
to
wander
loth
to
leave
for
they
were
right
witty
scholars
and
he
heard
their
aresouns
each
gen
other
as
touching
birth
and
righteousness
young
madden
maintaining
that
put
such
case
it
were
hard
the
wife
to
die
for
so
it
had
fallen
out
a
matter
of
some
year
agone
with
a
woman
of
eblana
in
horne
s
house
that
now
was
trespassed
out
of
this
world
and
the
self
night
next
before
her
death
all
leeches
and
pothecaries
had
taken
counsel
of
her
case
and
they
said
farther
she
should
live
because
in
the
beginning
they
said
the
woman
should
bring
forth
in
pain
and
wherefore
they
that
were
of
this
imagination
affirmed
how
young
madden
had
said
truth
for
he
had
conscience
to
let
her
die
and
not
few
and
of
these
was
young
lynch
were
in
doubt
that
the
world
was
now
right
evil
governed
as
it
was
never
other
howbeit
the
mean
people
believed
it
otherwise
but
the
law
nor
his
judges
did
provide
no
remedy
a
redress
god
grant
this
was
scant
said
but
all
cried
with
one
acclaim
nay
by
our
virgin
mother
the
wife
should
live
and
the
babe
to
die
in
colour
whereof
they
waxed
hot
upon
that
head
what
with
argument
and
what
for
their
drinking
but
the
franklin
lenehan
was
prompt
each
when
to
pour
them
ale
so
that
at
the
least
way
mirth
might
not
lack
then
young
madden
showed
all
the
whole
affair
and
said
how
that
she
was
dead
and
how
for
holy
religion
sake
by
rede
of
palmer
and
bedesman
and
for
a
vow
he
had
made
to
saint
ultan
of
arbraccan
her
goodman
husband
would
not
let
her
death
whereby
they
were
all
wondrous
grieved
to
whom
young
stephen
had
these
words
following
murmur
sirs
is
eke
oft
among
lay
folk
both
babe
and
parent
now
glorify
their
maker
the
one
in
limbo
gloom
the
other
in
purgefire
but
gramercy
what
of
those
godpossibled
souls
that
we
nightly
impossibilise
which
is
the
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
very
god
lord
and
giver
of
life
for
sirs
he
said
our
lust
is
brief
we
are
means
to
those
small
creatures
within
us
and
nature
has
other
ends
than
we
then
said
dixon
junior
to
punch
costello
wist
he
what
ends
but
he
had
overmuch
drunken
and
the
best
word
he
could
have
of
him
was
that
he
would
ever
dishonest
a
woman
whoso
she
were
or
wife
or
maid
or
leman
if
it
so
fortuned
him
to
be
delivered
of
his
spleen
of
lustihead
whereat
crotthers
of
alba
longa
sang
young
malachi
s
praise
of
that
beast
the
unicorn
how
once
in
the
millennium
he
cometh
by
his
horn
the
other
all
this
while
pricked
forward
with
their
jibes
wherewith
they
did
malice
him
witnessing
all
and
several
by
saint
foutinus
his
engines
that
he
was
able
to
do
any
manner
of
thing
that
lay
in
man
to
do
thereat
laughed
they
all
right
jocundly
only
young
stephen
and
sir
leopold
which
never
durst
laugh
too
open
by
reason
of
a
strange
humour
which
he
would
not
bewray
and
also
for
that
he
rued
for
her
that
bare
whoso
she
might
be
or
wheresoever
then
spake
young
stephen
orgulous
of
mother
church
that
would
cast
him
out
of
her
bosom
of
law
of
canons
of
lilith
patron
of
abortions
of
bigness
wrought
by
wind
of
seeds
of
brightness
or
by
potency
of
vampires
mouth
to
mouth
or
as
virgilius
saith
by
the
influence
of
the
occident
or
by
the
reek
of
moonflower
or
an
she
lie
with
a
woman
which
her
man
has
but
lain
with
effectu
secuto
or
peradventure
in
her
bath
according
to
the
opinions
of
averroes
and
moses
maimonides
he
said
also
how
at
the
end
of
the
second
month
a
human
soul
was
infused
and
how
in
all
our
holy
mother
foldeth
ever
souls
for
god
s
greater
glory
whereas
that
earthly
mother
which
was
but
a
dam
to
bear
beastly
should
die
by
canon
for
so
saith
he
that
holdeth
the
fisherman
s
seal
even
that
blessed
peter
on
which
rock
was
holy
church
for
all
ages
founded
all
they
bachelors
then
asked
of
sir
leopold
would
he
in
like
case
so
jeopard
her
person
as
risk
life
to
save
life
a
wariness
of
mind
he
would
answer
as
fitted
all
and
laying
hand
to
jaw
he
said
dissembling
as
his
wont
was
that
as
it
was
informed
him
who
had
ever
loved
the
art
of
physic
as
might
a
layman
and
agreeing
also
with
his
experience
of
so
seldomseen
an
accident
it
was
good
for
that
mother
church
belike
at
one
blow
had
birth
and
death
pence
and
in
such
sort
deliverly
he
scaped
their
questions
that
is
truth
pardy
said
dixon
and
or
i
err
a
pregnant
word
which
hearing
young
stephen
was
a
marvellous
glad
man
and
he
averred
that
he
who
stealeth
from
the
poor
lendeth
to
the
lord
for
he
was
of
a
wild
manner
when
he
was
drunken
and
that
he
was
now
in
that
taking
it
appeared
eftsoons
but
sir
leopold
was
passing
grave
maugre
his
word
by
cause
he
still
had
pity
of
the
terrorcausing
shrieking
of
shrill
women
in
their
labour
and
as
he
was
minded
of
his
good
lady
marion
that
had
borne
him
an
only
manchild
which
on
his
eleventh
day
on
live
had
died
and
no
man
of
art
could
save
so
dark
is
destiny
and
she
was
wondrous
stricken
of
heart
for
that
evil
hap
and
for
his
burial
did
him
on
a
fair
corselet
of
lamb
s
wool
the
flower
of
the
flock
lest
he
might
perish
utterly
and
lie
akeled
for
it
was
then
about
the
midst
of
the
winter
and
now
sir
leopold
that
had
of
his
body
no
manchild
for
an
heir
looked
upon
him
his
friend
s
son
and
was
shut
up
in
sorrow
for
his
forepassed
happiness
and
as
sad
as
he
was
that
him
failed
a
son
of
such
gentle
courage
for
all
accounted
him
of
real
parts
so
grieved
he
also
in
no
less
measure
for
young
stephen
for
that
he
lived
riotously
with
those
wastrels
and
murdered
his
goods
with
whores
about
that
present
time
young
stephen
filled
all
cups
that
stood
empty
so
as
there
remained
but
little
mo
if
the
prudenter
had
not
shadowed
their
approach
from
him
that
still
plied
it
very
busily
who
praying
for
the
intentions
of
the
sovereign
pontiff
he
gave
them
for
a
pledge
the
vicar
of
christ
which
also
as
he
said
is
vicar
of
bray
now

than

and
he
showed
them
glistering
coins
of
the
tribute
and
goldsmith
notes
the
worth
of
two
pound
nineteen
shilling
that
he
had
he
said
for
a
song
which
he
writ
they
all
admired
to
see
the
foresaid
riches
in
such
dearth
of

as
was
herebefore
his

then
these

this
passage
was
scarce
by
when
master
dixon
of
mary
in
eccles
goodly
grinning
asked
young
stephen
what
was
the
reason
why
he
had
not
cided
to
take
friar
s
vows
and
he
answered
him
obedience
in
the
womb
chastity
in
the
tomb
but
involuntary
poverty
all
his
days
master
lenehan
at
this
made
return
that
he
had
heard
of
those
nefarious
deeds
and
how
as
he
heard
hereof
counted
he
had
besmirched
the
lily
virtue
of
a
confiding
female
which
was
corruption
of
minors
and
they
all
intershowed
it
too
waxing
merry
and
toasting
to
his
fathership
but
he
said
very
entirely
it
was
clean
contrary
to
their
suppose
for
he
was
the
eternal
son
and
ever
virgin
thereat
mirth
grew
in
them
the
more
and
they
rehearsed
to
him
his
curious
rite
of
wedlock
for
the
disrobing
and
deflowering
of
spouses
as
the
priests
use
in
madagascar
island
she
to
be
in
guise
of
white
and
saffron
her
groom
in
white
and
grain
with
burning
of
nard
and
tapers
on
a
bridebed
while
clerks
sung
kyries
and
the
anthem
ut
novetur
sexus
omnis
corporis
mysterium
till
she
was
there
unmaided
he
gave
them
then
a
much
admirable
hymen
minim
by
those
delicate
poets
master
john
fletcher
and
master
francis
beaumont
that
is
in
their
maid
s
tragedy
that
was
writ
for
a
like
twining
of
lovers
to
bed
to
bed
was
the
burden
of
it
to
be
played
with
accompanable
concent
upon
the
virginals
an
exquisite
dulcet
epithalame
of
most
mollificative
suadency
for
juveniles
amatory
whom
the
odoriferous
flambeaus
of
the
paranymphs
have
escorted
to
the
quadrupedal
proscenium
of

young
stephen
said
indeed
to
his
best
remembrance
they
had
but
the
one
doxy
between
them
and
she
of
the
stews
to
make
shift
with
in
delights
amorous
for

ran
very
high

remember
erin
thy

how
thou

by

by

broughtedst
in
a
stranger
to
my
gates
to
commit
fornication
in
my
sight
and
to
wax
fat
and
kick
like
jeshurum
therefore
hast
thou
sinned
against
my
light
and
hast
made
me
thy
lord
to
be
the
slave
of
servants
return

milly
forget
me
not
o

why
hast
thou
done
this
abomination
before
me
that
thou
didst
spurn
me
for
a
merchant
of
jalaps
and
didst
deny
me
to
the
roman
and
to
the
indian

thy

and
from

and
from

of

unto
a
land
flowing
with
milk
and

but
thou
hast
suckled
me
with
a
bitter
milk
my
moon
and
my
sun
thou
hast
quenched
for
ever
and
thou
hast
left
me
alone
for
ever
in
the
dark
ways
of
my
bitterness
and
with
a
kiss
of
ashes
hast
thou
kissed

thundered
in

awful
the

came
now
the
storm
that
hist
his
heart
and
master
lynch
bade
him
have
a
care
to
flout
and
witwanton
as
the
god
self
was
angered
for
his
hellprate
and
paganry
and
he
that
had
erst
challenged
to
be
so
doughty
waxed
wan
as
they
might
all
mark
and
shrank
together
and
his
pitch
that
was
before
so
haught
uplift
was
now
of
a
sudden
quite
plucked
down
and
his
heart
shook
within
the
cage
of
his
breast
as
he
tasted
the
rumour
of
that
storm
then
did
some
mock
and
some
jeer
and
punch
costello
fell
hard
again
to
his
yale
which
master
lenehan
vowed
he
would
do
after
and
he
was
indeed
but
a
word
and
a
blow
on
any
the
least
colour
but
the
braggart
boaster
cried
that
an
old
nobodaddy
was
in
his
cups
it
was
muchwhat
indifferent
and
he
would
not
lag
behind
his
lead
but
this
was
only
to
dye
his
desperation
as
cowed
he
crouched
in
horne
s
hall
he
drank
indeed
at
one
draught
to
pluck
up
a
heart
of
any
grace
for
it
thundered
long
rumblingly
over
all
the
heavens
so
that
master
madden
being
godly
certain
whiles
knocked
him
on
his
ribs
upon
that
crack
of
doom
and
master
bloom
at
the
braggart
s
side
spoke
to
him
calming
words
to
slumber
his
great
fear
advertising
how
it
was
no
other
thing
but
a
hubbub
noise
that
he
heard
the
discharge
of
fluid
from
the
thunderhead
look
you
having
taken
place
and
all
of
the
order
of
a
natural
phenomenon
but
was
young
boasthard
s
fear
vanquished
by
calmer
s
words
no
for
he
had
in
his
bosom
a
spike
named
bitterness
which
could
not
by
words
be
done
away
and
was
he
then
neither
calm
like
the
one
nor
godly
like
the
other
he
was
neither
as
much
as
he
would
have
liked
to
be
either
but
could
he
not
have
endeavoured
to
have
found
again
as
in
his
youth
the
bottle
holiness
that
then
he
lived
withal
indeed
no
for
grace
was
not
there
to
find
that
bottle
heard
he
then
in
that
clap
the
voice
of
the
god
bringforth
or
what
calmer
said
a
hubbub
of
phenomenon
heard
why
he
could
not
but
hear
unless
he
had
plugged
him
up
the
tube
understanding
which
he
had
not
done
for
through
that
tube
he
saw
that
he
was
in
the
land
of
phenomenon
where
he
must
for
a
certain
one
day
die
as
he
was
like
the
rest
too
a
passing
show
and
would
he
not
accept
to
die
like
the
rest
and
pass
away
by
no
means
would
he
though
he
must
nor
would
he
make
more
shows
according
as
men
do
with
wives
which
phenomenon
has
commanded
them
to
do
by
the
book
law
then
wotted
he
nought
of
that
other
land
which
is
called
that
is
the
land
of
promise
which
behoves
to
the
king
delightful
and
shall
be
for
ever
where
there
is
no
death
and
no
birth
neither
wiving
nor
mothering
at
which
all
shall
come
as
many
as
believe
on
it
yes
pious
had
told
him
of
that
land
and
chaste
had
pointed
him
to
the
way
but
the
reason
was
that
in
the
way
he
fell
in
with
a
certain
whore
of
an
eyepleasing
exterior
whose
name
she
said
is
and
she
beguiled
him
wrongways
from
the
true
path
by
her
flatteries
that
she
said
to
him
as
ho
you
pretty
man
turn
aside
hither
and
i
will
show
you
a
brave
place
and
she
lay
at
him
so
flatteringly
that
she
had
him
in
her
grot
which
is
named
or
by
some
learned
carnal
concupiscence
this
was
it
what
all
that
company
that
sat
there
at
commons
in
manse
of
mothers
the
most
lusted
after
and
if
they
met
with
this
whore
which
was
within
all
foul
plagues
monsters
and
a
wicked
devil
they
would
strain
the
last
but
they
would
make
at
her
and
know
her
for
regarding
they
said
it
was
nought
else
but
notion
and
they
could
conceive
no
thought
of
it
for
first
whither
she
ticed
them
was
the
very
goodliest
grot
and
in
it
were
four
pillows
on
which
were
four
tickets
with
these
words
printed
on
them
pickaback
and
topsyturvy
and
shameface
and
cheek
by
jowl
and
second
for
that
foul
plague
allpox
and
the
monsters
they
cared
not
for
them
for
preservative
had
given
them
a
stout
shield
of
oxengut
and
third
that
they
might
take
no
hurt
neither
from
offspring
that
was
that
wicked
devil
by
virtue
of
this
same
shield
which
was
named
killchild

grievous
rage
that
he
would
presently
lift
his

up

spill
their

shall

and
i
hear
that
mr

has
done
a
prophetical
charm
of
the
same
gist
out
of
the
hindustanish
for
his
farmer
s
gazette
to
have
three
things
in
all
but
this
a
mere
fetch
without
bottom
of
reason
for
old
crones
and
bairns
yet
sometimes
they
are
found
in
the
right
guess
with
their
queerities
no
telling
how
with
this
came
up
lenehan
to
the
feet
of
the
table
to
say
how
the
letter
was
in
that
night
s
gazette
and
he
made
a
show
to
find
it
about
him
for
he
swore
with
an
oath
that
he
had
been
at
pains
about
it
but
on
stephen
s
persuasion
he
gave
over
the
search
and
was
bidden
to
sit
near
by
which
he
did
mighty
brisk
he
was
a
kind
of
sport
gentleman
that
went
for
a
merryandrew
or
honest
pickle
and
what
belonged
of
women
horseflesh
or
hot
scandal
he
had
it
pat
to
tell
the
truth
he
was
mean
in
fortunes
and
for
the
most
part
hankered
about
the
coffeehouses
and
low
taverns
with
crimps
ostlers
bookies
paul
s
men
runners
flatcaps
waistcoateers
ladies
of
the
bagnio
and
other
rogues
of
the
game
or
with
a
chanceable
catchpole
or
a
tipstaff
often
at
nights
till
broad
day
of
whom
he
picked
up
between
his
sackpossets
much
loose
gossip
he
took
his
ordinary
at
a
boilingcook
s
and
if
he
had
but
gotten
into
him
a
mess
of
broken
victuals
or
a
platter
of
tripes
with
a
bare
tester
in
his
purse
he
could
always
bring
himself
off
with
his
tongue
some
randy
quip
he
had
from
a
punk
or
whatnot
that
every
mother
s
son
of
them
would
burst
their
sides
the
other
costello
that
is
hearing
this
talk
asked
was
it
poetry
or
a
tale
faith
no
he
says
frank
that
was
his
name
tis
all
about
kerry
cows
that
are
to
be
butchered
along
of
the
plague
but
they
can
go
hang
says
he
with
a
wink
for
me
with
their
bully
beef
a
pox
on
it
there
s
as
good
fish
in
this
tin
as
ever
came
out
of
it
and
very
friendly
he
offered
to
take
of
some
salty
sprats
that
stood
by
which
he
had
eyed
wishly
in
the
meantime
and
found
the
place
which
was
indeed
the
chief
design
of
his
embassy
as
he
was
sharpset
mort
aux
vaches
says
frank
then
in
the
french
language
that
had
been
indentured
to
a
brandyshipper
that
has
a
winelodge
in
bordeaux
and
he
spoke
french
like
a
gentleman
too
from
a
child
this
frank
had
been
a
donought
that
his
father
a
headborough
who
could
ill
keep
him
to
school
to
learn
his
letters
and
the
use
of
the
globes
matriculated
at
the
university
to
study
the
mechanics
but
he
took
the
bit
between
his
teeth
like
a
raw
colt
and
was
more
familiar
with
the
justiciary
and
the
parish
beadle
than
with
his
volumes
one
time
he
would
be
a
playactor
then
a
sutler
or
a
welsher
then
nought
would
keep
him
from
the
bearpit
and
the
cocking
main
then
he
was
for
the
ocean
sea
or
to
hoof
it
on
the
roads
with
the
romany
folk
kidnapping
a
squire
s
heir
by
favour
of
moonlight
or
fecking
maids
linen
or
choking
chicken
behind
a
hedge
he
had
been
off
as
many
times
as
a
cat
has
lives
and
back
again
with
naked
pockets
as
many
more
to
his
father
the
headborough
who
shed
a
pint
of
tears
as
often
as
he
saw
him
what
says
mr
leopold
with
his
hands
across
that
was
earnest
to
know
the
drift
of
it
will
they
slaughter
all
i
protest
i
saw
them
but
this
day
morning
going
to
the
liverpool
boats
says
he
i
can
scarce
believe
tis
so
bad
says
he
and
he
had
experience
of
the
like
brood
beasts
and
of
springers
greasy
hoggets
and
wether
wool
having
been
some
years
before
actuary
for
mr
joseph
cuffe
a
worthy
salesmaster
that
drove
his
trade
for
live
stock
and
meadow
auctions
hard
by
mr
gavin
low
s
yard
in
prussia
street
i
question
with
you
there
says
he
more
like
tis
the
hoose
or
the
timber
tongue
mr
stephen
a
little
moved
but
very
handsomely
told
him
no
such
matter
and
that
he
had
dispatches
from
the
emperor
s
chief
tailtickler
thanking
him
for
the
hospitality
that
was
sending
over
doctor
rinderpest
the
bestquoted
cowcatcher
in
all
muscovy
with
a
bolus
or
two
of
physic
to
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
come
come
says
mr
vincent
plain
dealing
he
ll
find
himself
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
if
he
meddles
with
a
bull
that
s
irish
says
he
irish
by
name
and
irish
by
nature
says
mr
stephen
and
he
sent
the
ale
purling
about
an
irish
bull
in
an
english
chinashop
i
conceive
you
says
mr
dixon
it
is
that
same
bull
that
was
sent
to
our
island
by
farmer
nicholas
the
bravest
cattlebreeder
of
them
all
with
an
emerald
ring
in
his
nose
true
for
you
says
mr
vincent
cross
the
table
and
a
bullseye
into
the
bargain
says
he
and
a
plumper
and
a
portlier
bull
says
he
never
shit
on
shamrock
he
had
horns
galore
a
coat
of
cloth
of
gold
and
a
sweet
smoky
breath
coming
out
of
his
nostrils
so
that
the
women
of
our
island
leaving
doughballs
and
rollingpins
followed
after
him
hanging
his
bulliness
in
daisychains
what
for
that
says
mr
dixon
but
before
he
came
over
farmer
nicholas
that
was
a
eunuch
had
him
properly
gelded
by
a
college
of
doctors
who
were
no
better
off
than
himself
so
be
off
now
says
he
and
do
all
my
cousin
german
the
lord
harry
tells
you
and
take
a
farmer
s
blessing
and
with
that
he
slapped
his
posteriors
very
soundly
but
the
slap
and
the
blessing
stood
him
friend
says
mr
vincent
for
to
make
up
he
taught
him
a
trick
worth
two
of
the
other
so
that
maid
wife
abbess
and
widow
to
this
day
affirm
that
they
would
rather
any
time
of
the
month
whisper
in
his
ear
in
the
dark
of
a
cowhouse
or
get
a
lick
on
the
nape
from
his
long
holy
tongue
than
lie
with
the
finest
strapping
young
ravisher
in
the
four
fields
of
all
ireland
another
then
put
in
his
word
and
they
dressed
him
says
he
in
a
point
shift
and
petticoat
with
a
tippet
and
girdle
and
ruffles
on
his
wrists
and
clipped
his
forelock
and
rubbed
him
all
over
with
spermacetic
oil
and
built
stables
for
him
at
every
turn
of
the
road
with
a
gold
manger
in
each
full
of
the
best
hay
in
the
market
so
that
he
could
doss
and
dung
to
his
heart
s
content
by
this
time
the
father
of
the
faithful
for
so
they
called
him
was
grown
so
heavy
that
he
could
scarce
walk
to
pasture
to
remedy
which
our
cozening
dames
and
damsels
brought
him
his
fodder
in
their
apronlaps
and
as
soon
as
his
belly
was
full
he
would
rear
up
on
his
hind
quarters
to
show
their
ladyships
a
mystery
and
roar
and
bellow
out
of
him
in
bulls
language
and
they
all
after
him
ay
says
another
and
so
pampered
was
he
that
he
would
suffer
nought
to
grow
in
all
the
land
but
green
grass
for
himself
for
that
was
the
only
colour
to
his
mind
and
there
was
a
board
put
up
on
a
hillock
in
the
middle
of
the
island
with
a
printed
notice
saying
by
the
lord
harry
green
is
the
grass
that
grows
on
the
ground
and
says
mr
dixon
if
ever
he
got
scent
of
a
cattleraider
in
roscommon
or
the
wilds
of
connemara
or
a
husbandman
in
sligo
that
was
sowing
as
much
as
a
handful
of
mustard
or
a
bag
of
rapeseed
out
he
d
run
amok
over
half
the
countryside
rooting
up
with
his
horns
whatever
was
planted
and
all
by
lord
harry
s
orders
there
was
bad
blood
between
them
at
first
says
mr
vincent
and
the
lord
harry
called
farmer
nicholas
all
the
old
nicks
in
the
world
and
an
old
whoremaster
that
kept
seven
trulls
in
his
house
and
i
ll
meddle
in
his
matters
says
he
i
ll
make
that
animal
smell
hell
says
he
with
the
help
of
that
good
pizzle
my
father
left
me
but
one
evening
says
mr
dixon
when
the
lord
harry
was
cleaning
his
royal
pelt
to
go
to
dinner
after
winning
a
boatrace
he
had
spade
oars
for
himself
but
the
first
rule
of
the
course
was
that
the
others
were
to
row
with
pitchforks
he
discovered
in
himself
a
wonderful
likeness
to
a
bull
and
on
picking
up
a
blackthumbed
chapbook
that
he
kept
in
the
pantry
he
found
sure
enough
that
he
was
a
lefthanded
descendant
of
the
famous
champion
bull
of
the
romans
bos
bovum
which
is
good
bog
latin
for
boss
of
the
show
after
that
says
mr
vincent
the
lord
harry
put
his
head
into
a
cow
s
drinkingtrough
in
the
presence
of
all
his
courtiers
and
pulling
it
out
again
told
them
all
his
new
name
then
with
the
water
running
off
him
he
got
into
an
old
smock
and
skirt
that
had
belonged
to
his
grandmother
and
bought
a
grammar
of
the
bulls
language
to
study
but
he
could
never
learn
a
word
of
it
except
the
first
personal
pronoun
which
he
copied
out
big
and
got
off
by
heart
and
if
ever
he
went
out
for
a
walk
he
filled
his
pockets
with
chalk
to
write
it
upon
what
took
his
fancy
the
side
of
a
rock
or
a
teahouse
table
or
a
bale
of
cotton
or
a
corkfloat
in
short
he
and
the
bull
of
ireland
were
soon
as
fast
friends
as
an
arse
and
a
shirt
they
were
says
mr
stephen
and
the
end
was
that
the
men
of
the
island
seeing
no
help
was
toward
as
the
ungrate
women
were
all
of
one
mind
made
a
wherry
raft
loaded
themselves
and
their
bundles
of
chattels
on
shipboard
set
all
masts
erect
manned
the
yards
sprang
their
luff
heaved
to
spread
three
sheets
in
the
wind
put
her
head
between
wind
and
water
weighed
anchor
ported
her
helm
ran
up
the
jolly
roger
gave
three
times
three
let
the
bullgine
run
pushed
off
in
their
bumboat
and
put
to
sea
to
recover
the
main
of
america
which
was
the
occasion
says
mr
vincent
of
the
composing
by
a
boatswain
of
that
rollicking
chanty
peter
s
but
a
pissabed
a
man
s
a
man
for
a
that
our
worthy
acquaintance
mr
malachi
mulligan
now
appeared
in
the
doorway
as
the
students
were
finishing
their
apologue
accompanied
with
a
friend
whom
he
had
just
rencountered
a
young
gentleman
his
name
alec
bannon
who
had
late
come
to
town
it
being
his
intention
to
buy
a
colour
or
a
cornetcy
in
the
fencibles
and
list
for
the
wars
mr
mulligan
was
civil
enough
to
express
some
relish
of
it
all
the
more
as
it
jumped
with
a
project
of
his
own
for
the
cure
of
the
very
evil
that
had
been
touched
on
whereat
he
handed
round
to
the
company
a
set
of
pasteboard
cards
which
he
had
had
printed
that
day
at
mr
quinnell
s
bearing
a
legend
printed
in
fair
italics
mr
malachi
mulligan
fertiliser
and
incubator
lambay
island
his
project
as
he
went
on
to
expound
was
to
withdraw
from
the
round
of
idle
pleasures
such
as
form
the
chief
business
of
sir
fopling
popinjay
and
sir
milksop
quidnunc
in
town
and
to
devote
himself
to
the
noblest
task
for
which
our
bodily
organism
has
been
framed
well
let
us
hear
of
it
good
my
friend
said
mr
dixon
i
make
no
doubt
it
smacks
of
wenching
come
be
seated
both
tis
as
cheap
sitting
as
standing
mr
mulligan
accepted
of
the
invitation
and
expatiating
upon
his
design
told
his
hearers
that
he
had
been
led
into
this
thought
by
a
consideration
of
the
causes
of
sterility
both
the
inhibitory
and
the
prohibitory
whether
the
inhibition
in
its
turn
were
due
to
conjugal
vexations
or
to
a
parsimony
of
the
balance
as
well
as
whether
the
prohibition
proceeded
from
defects
congenital
or
from
proclivities
acquired
it
grieved
him
plaguily
he
said
to
see
the
nuptial
couch
defrauded
of
its
dearest
pledges
and
to
reflect
upon
so
many
agreeable
females
with
rich
jointures
a
prey
to
the
vilest
bonzes
who
hide
their
flambeau
under
a
bushel
in
an
uncongenial
cloister
or
lose
their
womanly
bloom
in
the
embraces
of
some
unaccountable
muskin
when
they
might
multiply
the
inlets
of
happiness
sacrificing
the
inestimable
jewel
of
their
sex
when
a
hundred
pretty
fellows
were
at
hand
to
caress
this
he
assured
them
made
his
heart
weep
to
curb
this
inconvenient
which
he
concluded
due
to
a
suppression
of
latent
heat
having
advised
with
certain
counsellors
of
worth
and
inspected
into
this
matter
he
had
resolved
to
purchase
in
fee
simple
for
ever
the
freehold
of
lambay
island
from
its
holder
lord
talbot
de
malahide
a
tory
gentleman
of
note
much
in
favour
with
our
ascendancy
party
he
proposed
to
set
up
there
a
national
fertilising
farm
to
be
named
omphalos
with
an
obelisk
hewn
and
erected
after
the
fashion
of
egypt
and
to
offer
his
dutiful
yeoman
services
for
the
fecundation
of
any
female
of
what
grade
of
life
soever
who
should
there
direct
to
him
with
the
desire
of
fulfilling
the
functions
of
her
natural
money
was
no
object
he
said
nor
would
he
take
a
penny
for
his
pains
the
poorest
kitchenwench
no
less
than
the
opulent
lady
of
fashion
if
so
be
their
constructions
and
their
tempers
were
warm
persuaders
for
their
petitions
would
find
in
him
their
man
for
his
nutriment
he
shewed
how
he
would
feed
himself
exclusively
upon
a
diet
of
savoury
tubercles
and
fish
and
coneys
there
the
flesh
of
these
latter
prolific
rodents
being
highly
recommended
for
his
purpose
both
broiled
and
stewed
with
a
blade
of
mace
and
a
pod
or
two
of
capsicum
chillies
after
this
homily
which
he
delivered
with
much
warmth
of
asseveration
mr
mulligan
in
a
trice
put
off
from
his
hat
a
kerchief
with
which
he
had
shielded
it
they
both
it
seems
had
been
overtaken
by
the
rain
and
for
all
their
mending
their
pace
had
taken
water
as
might
be
observed
by
mr
mulligan
s
smallclothes
of
a
hodden
grey
which
was
now
somewhat
piebald
his
project
meanwhile
was
very
favourably
entertained
by
his
auditors
and
won
hearty
eulogies
from
all
though
mr
dixon
of
mary
s
excepted
to
it
asking
with
a
finicking
air
did
he
purpose
also
to
carry
coals
to
newcastle
mr
mulligan
however
made
court
to
the
scholarly
by
an
apt
quotation
from
the
classics
which
as
it
dwelt
upon
his
memory
seemed
to
him
a
sound
and
tasteful
support
of
his
contention
talis

while
for
those
of
ruder
wit
he
drove
home
his
point
by
analogies
of
the
animal
kingdom
more
suitable
to
their
stomach
the
buck
and
doe
of
the
forest
glade
the
farmyard
drake
and
duck
valuing
himself
not
a
little
upon
his
elegance
being
indeed
a
proper
man
of
person
this
talkative
now
applied
himself
to
his
dress
with
animadversions
of
some
heat
upon
the
sudden
whimsy
of
the
atmospherics
while
the
company
lavished
their
encomiums
upon
the
project
he
had
advanced
the
young
gentleman
his
friend
overjoyed
as
he
was
at
a
passage
that
had
late
befallen
him
could
not
forbear
to
tell
it
his
nearest
neighbour
mr
mulligan
now
perceiving
the
table
asked
for
whom
were
those
loaves
and
fishes
and
seeing
the
stranger
he
made
him
a
civil
bow
and
said
pray
sir
was
you
in
need
of
any
professional
assistance
we
could
give
who
upon
his
offer
thanked
him
very
heartily
though
preserving
his
proper
distance
and
replied
that
he
was
come
there
about
a
lady
now
an
inmate
of
horne
s
house
that
was
in
an
interesting
condition
poor
body
from
woman
s
woe
and
here
he
fetched
a
deep
sigh
to
know
if
her
happiness
had
yet
taken
place
mr
dixon
to
turn
the
table
took
on
to
ask
of
mr
mulligan
himself
whether
his
incipient
ventripotence
upon
which
he
rallied
him
betokened
an
ovoblastic
gestation
in
the
prostatic
utricle
or
male
womb
or
was
due
as
with
the
noted
physician
mr
austin
meldon
to
a
wolf
in
the
stomach
for
answer
mr
mulligan
in
a
gale
of
laughter
at
his
smalls
smote
himself
bravely
below
the
diaphragm
exclaiming
with
an
admirable
droll
mimic
of
mother
grogan
the
most
excellent
creature
of
her
sex
though
tis
pity
she
s
a
trollop
there
s
a
belly
that
never
bore
a
bastard
this
was
so
happy
a
conceit
that
it
renewed
the
storm
of
mirth
and
threw
the
whole
room
into
the
most
violent
agitations
of
delight
the
spry
rattle
had
run
on
in
the
same
vein
of
mimicry
but
for
some
larum
in
the
antechamber
here
the
listener
who
was
none
other
than
the
scotch
student
a
little
fume
of
a
fellow
blond
as
tow
congratulated
in
the
liveliest
fashion
with
the
young
gentleman
and
interrupting
the
narrative
at
a
salient
point
having
desired
his
visavis
with
a
polite
beck
to
have
the
obligingness
to
pass
him
a
flagon
of
cordial
waters
at
the
same
time
by
a
questioning
poise
of
the
head
a
whole
century
of
polite
breeding
had
not
achieved
so
nice
a
gesture
to
which
was
united
an
equivalent
but
contrary
balance
of
the
bottle
asked
the
narrator
as
plainly
as
was
ever
done
in
words
if
he
might
treat
him
with
a
cup
of
it
mais
bien
sûr
noble
stranger
said
he
cheerily
et
mille
compliments
that
you
may
and
very
opportunely
there
wanted
nothing
but
this
cup
to
crown
my
felicity
but
gracious
heaven
was
i
left
with
but
a
crust
in
my
wallet
and
a
cupful
of
water
from
the
well
my
god
i
would
accept
of
them
and
find
it
in
my
heart
to
kneel
down
upon
the
ground
and
give
thanks
to
the
powers
above
for
the
happiness
vouchsafed
me
by
the
giver
of
good
things
with
these
words
he
approached
the
goblet
to
his
lips
took
a
complacent
draught
of
the
cordial
slicked
his
hair
and
opening
his
bosom
out
popped
a
locket
that
hung
from
a
silk
riband
that
very
picture
which
he
had
cherished
ever
since
her
hand
had
wrote
therein
gazing
upon
those
features
with
a
world
of
tenderness
ah
monsieur
he
said
had
you
but
beheld
her
as
i
did
with
these
eyes
at
that
affecting
instant
with
her
dainty

how

at

a

amid
the

of

a

miss

in

retired
with

just

to
put

with
a
laudable
fortitude
and

said
he
with
those
who
without
wit
to
enliven
or
learning
to
instruct
revile
an
ennobling
profession
which
saving
the
reverence
due
to
the
deity
is
the
greatest
power
for
happiness
upon
the
earth
i
am
positive
when
i
say
that
if
need
were
i
could
produce
a
cloud
of
witnesses
to
the
excellence
of
her
noble
exercitations
which
so
far
from
being
a
byword
should
be
a
glorious
incentive
in
the
human
breast
i
can
not
away
with
them
what
malign
such
an
one
the
amiable
miss
callan
who
is
the
lustre
of
her
own
sex
and
the
astonishment
of
ours
and
at
an
instant
the
most
momentous
that
can
befall
a
puny
child
of
clay
perish
the
thought
i
shudder
to
think
of
the
future
of
a
race
where
the
seeds
of
such
malice
have
been
sown
and
where
no
right
reverence
is
rendered
to
mother
and
maid
in
house
of
horne
having
delivered
himself
of
this
rebuke
he
saluted
those
present
on
the
by
and
repaired
to
the
door
a
murmur
of
approval
arose
from
all
and
some
were
for
ejecting
the
low
soaker
without
more
ado
a
design
which
would
have
been
effected
nor
would
he
have
received
more
than
his
bare
deserts
had
he
not
abridged
his
transgression
by
affirming
with
a
horrid
imprecation
for
he
swore
a
round
hand
that
he
was
as
good
a
son
of
the
true
fold
as
ever
drew
breath
stap
my
vitals
said
he
them
was
always
the
sentiments
of
honest
frank
costello
which
i
was
bred
up
most
particular
to
honour
thy
father
and
thy
mother
that
had
the
best
hand
to
a
rolypoly
or
a
hasty
pudding
as
you
ever
see
what
i
always
looks
back
on
with
a
loving
heart
to
revert
to
mr
bloom
who
after
his
first
entry
had
been
conscious
of
some
impudent
mocks
which
he
however
had
borne
with
as
being
the
fruits
of
that
age
upon
which
it
is
commonly
charged
that
it
knows
not
pity
the
young
sparks
it
is
true
were
as
full
of
extravagancies
as
overgrown
children
the
words
of
their
tumultuary
discussions
were
difficultly
understood
and
not
often
nice
their
testiness
and
outrageous
mots
were
such
that
his
intellects
resiled
from
nor
were
they
scrupulously
sensible
of
the
proprieties
though
their
fund
of
strong
animal
spirits
spoke
in
their
behalf
but
the
word
of
mr
costello
was
an
unwelcome
language
for
him
for
he
nauseated
the
wretch
that
seemed
to
him
a
cropeared
creature
of
a
misshapen
gibbosity
born
out
of
wedlock
and
thrust
like
a
crookback
toothed
and
feet
first
into
the
world
which
the
dint
of
the
surgeon
s
pliers
in
his
skull
lent
indeed
a
colour
to
so
as
to
put
him
in
thought
of
that
missing
link
of
creation
s
chain
desiderated
by
the
late
ingenious
mr
darwin
it
was
now
for
more
than
the
middle
span
of
our
allotted
years
that
he
had
passed
through
the
thousand
vicissitudes
of
existence
and
being
of
a
wary
ascendancy
and
self
a
man
of
rare
forecast
he
had
enjoined
his
heart
to
repress
all
motions
of
a
rising
choler
and
by
intercepting
them
with
the
readiest
precaution
foster
within
his
breast
that
plenitude
of
sufferance
which
base
minds
jeer
at
rash
judgers
scorn
and
all
find
tolerable
and
but
tolerable
to
those
who
create
themselves
wits
at
the
cost
of
feminine
delicacy
a
habit
of
mind
which
he
never
did
hold
with
to
them
he
would
concede
neither
to
bear
the
name
nor
to
herit
the
tradition
of
a
proper
breeding
while
for
such
that
having
lost
all
forbearance
can
lose
no
more
there
remained
the
sharp
antidote
of
experience
to
cause
their
insolency
to
beat
a
precipitate
and
inglorious
retreat
not
but
what
he
could
feel
with
mettlesome
youth
which
caring
nought
for
the
mows
of
dotards
or
the
gruntlings
of
the
severe
is
ever
as
the
chaste
fancy
of
the
holy
writer
expresses
it
for
eating
of
the
tree
forbid
it
yet
not
so
far
forth
as
to
pretermit
humanity
upon
any
condition
soever
towards
a
gentlewoman
when
she
was
about
her
lawful
occasions
to
conclude
while
from
the
sister
s
words
he
had
reckoned
upon
a
speedy
delivery
he
was
however
it
must
be
owned
not
a
little
alleviated
by
the
intelligence
that
the
issue
so
auspicated
after
an
ordeal
of
such
duress
now
testified
once
more
to
the
mercy
as
well
as
to
the
bounty
of
the
supreme
being
accordingly
he
broke
his
mind
to
his
neighbour
saying
that
to
express
his
notion
of
the
thing
his
opinion
who
ought
not
perchance
to
express
one
was
that
one
must
have
a
cold
constitution
and
a
frigid
genius
not
to
be
rejoiced
by
this
freshest
news
of
the
fruition
of
her
confinement
since
she
had
been
in
such
pain
through
no
fault
of
hers
the
dressy
young
blade
said
it
was
her
husband
s
that
put
her
in
that
expectation
or
at
least
it
ought
to
be
unless
she
were
another
ephesian
matron
i
must
acquaint
you
said
mr
crotthers
clapping
on
the
table
so
as
to
evoke
a
resonant
comment
of
emphasis
old
glory
allelujurum
was
round
again
today
an
elderly
man
with
dundrearies
preferring
through
his
nose
a
request
to
have
word
of
wilhelmina
my
life
as
he
calls
her
i
bade
him
hold
himself
in
readiness
for
that
the
event
would
burst
anon
slife
i
ll
be
round
with
you
i
can
not
but
extol
the
virile
potency
of
the
old
bucko
that
could
still
knock
another
child
out
of
her
all
fell
to
praising
of
it
each
after
his
own
fashion
though
the
same
young
blade
held
with
his
former
view
that
another
than
her
conjugial
had
been
the
man
in
the
gap
a
clerk
in
orders
a
linkboy
virtuous
or
an
itinerant
vendor
of
articles
needed
in
every
household
singular
communed
the
guest
with
himself
the
wonderfully
unequal
faculty
of
metempsychosis
possessed
by
them
that
the
puerperal
dormitory
and
the
dissecting
theatre
should
be
the
seminaries
of
such
frivolity
that
the
mere
acquisition
of
academic
titles
should
suffice
to
transform
in
a
pinch
of
time
these
votaries
of
levity
into
exemplary
practitioners
of
an
art
which
most
men
anywise
eminent
have
esteemed
the
noblest
but
he
further
added
it
is
mayhap
to
relieve
the
pentup
feelings
that
in
common
oppress
them
for
i
have
more
than
once
observed
that
birds
of
a
feather
laugh
together
but
with
what
fitness
let
it
be
asked
of
the
noble
lord
his
patron
has
this
alien
whom
the
concession
of
a
gracious
prince
has
admitted
to
civic
rights
constituted
himself
the
lord
paramount
of
our
internal
polity
where
is
now
that
gratitude
which
loyalty
should
have
counselled
during
the
recent
war
whenever
the
enemy
had
a
temporary
advantage
with
his
granados
did
this
traitor
to
his
kind
not
seize
that
moment
to
discharge
his
piece
against
the
empire
of
which
he
is
a
tenant
at
will
while
he
trembled
for
the
security
of
his
four
per
cents
has
he
forgotten
this
as
he
forgets
all
benefits
received
or
is
it
that
from
being
a
deluder
of
others
he
has
become
at
last
his
own
dupe
as
he
is
if
report
belie
him
not
his
own
and
his
only
enjoyer
far
be
it
from
candour
to
violate
the
bedchamber
of
a
respectable
lady
the
daughter
of
a
gallant
major
or
to
cast
the
most
distant
reflections
upon
her
virtue
but
if
he
challenges
attention
there
as
it
was
indeed
highly
his
interest
not
to
have
done
then
be
it
so
unhappy
woman
she
has
been
too
long
and
too
persistently
denied
her
legitimate
prerogative
to
listen
to
his
objurgations
with
any
other
feeling
than
the
derision
of
the
desperate
he
says
this
a
censor
of
morals
a
very
pelican
in
his
piety
who
did
not
scruple
oblivious
of
the
ties
of
nature
to
attempt
illicit
intercourse
with
a
female
domestic
drawn
from
the
lowest
strata
of
society
nay
had
the

not
been

tutelary
angel
it
had
gone
with
her
as
hard
as
with

the
egyptian
in
the
question
of
the
grazing
lands
his
peevish
asperity
is
notorious
and
in
mr
cuffe
s
hearing
brought
upon
him
from
an
indignant
rancher
a
scathing
retort
couched
in
terms
as
straightforward
as
they
were
bucolic
it
ill
becomes
him
to
preach
that
gospel
has
he
not
nearer
home
a
seedfield
that
lies
fallow
for
the
want
of
the
ploughshare
a
habit
reprehensible
at
puberty
is
second
nature
and
an
opprobrium
in
middle
life
if
he
must
dispense
his
balm
of
gilead
in
nostrums
and
apothegms
of
dubious
taste
to
restore
to
health
a
generation
of
unfledged
profligates
let
his
practice
consist
better
with
the
doctrines
that
now
engross
him
his
marital
breast
is
the
repository
of
secrets
which
decorum
is
reluctant
to
adduce
the
lewd
suggestions
of
some
faded
beauty
may
console
him
for
a
consort
neglected
and
debauched
but
this
new
exponent
of
morals
and
healer
of
ills
is
at
his
best
an
exotic
tree
which
when
rooted
in
its
native
orient
throve
and
flourished
and
was
abundant
in
balm
but
transplanted
to
a
clime
more
temperate
its
roots
have
lost
their
quondam
vigour
while
the
stuff
that
comes
away
from
it
is
stagnant
acid
and
inoperative
the
news
was
imparted
with
a
circumspection
recalling
the
ceremonial
usage
of
the
sublime
porte
by
the
second
female
infirmarian
to
the
junior
medical
officer
in
residence
who
in
his
turn
announced
to
the
delegation
that
an
heir
had
been
born
when
he
had
betaken
himself
to
the
women
s
apartment
to
assist
at
the
prescribed
ceremony
of
the
afterbirth
in
the
presence
of
the
secretary
of

for
domestic
affairs
and
the
members
of
the
privy
council
silent
in
unanimous
exhaustion
and
approbation
the
delegates
chafing
under
the
length
and
solemnity
of
their
vigil
and
hoping
that
the
joyful
occurrence
would
palliate
a
licence
which
the
simultaneous
absence
of
abigail
and
obstetrician
rendered
the
easier
broke
out
at
once
into
a
strife
of
tongues
in
vain
the
voice
of
mr
canvasser
bloom
was
heard
endeavouring
to
urge
to
mollify
to
refrain
the
moment
was
too
propitious
for
the
display
of
that
discursiveness
which
seemed
the
only
bond
of
union
among
tempers
so
divergent
every
phase
of
the
situation
was
successively
eviscerated
the
prenatal
repugnance
of
uterine
brothers
the
caesarean
section
posthumity
with
respect
to

and
that
rarer

with

fratricidal

he
delivered
briefly

perfunctorily
the

to

he
conjured
up

the

beside

slid
back
and
in

appeared
haines

did
not

depicted
on

eyed
them
with

i
anticipated
some

began
with
an
eldritch
laugh
for
which
it
seems

yes
it

i

the

reminding

he
asked
about

where

neither

you
have
spoken
of

across

encircled

those

vincent
said
to

vincent
lenehan
said
laying
a
hand
on
the
shoulder
near
him
have
no
fear
he
could
not
leave
his
mother
an
orphan
the
young
man
s
face
grew
dark
all
could
see
how
hard
it
was
for
him
to
be
reminded
of
his
promise
and
of
his
recent
loss
he
would
have
withdrawn
from
the
feast
had
not
the
noise
of
voices
allayed
the
smart
madden
had
lost
five
drachmas
on

for
a
whim
of
the
rider
s

lenehan
as
much
more
he
told
them
of
the

the

fell
and
huuh
off
scamper
the

ran
out
freshly
with
madden
up
she
was
leading
the
field
all
hearts
were
beating
even
phyllis
could
not
contain
herself
she
waved
her
scarf
and
cried
huzzah
sceptre
wins
but
in
the
straight
on
the
run
home
when
all
were
in
close
order
the
dark
horse
throwaway
drew
level
reached
outstripped
her
all
was
lost
now
phyllis
was
silent
her
eyes
were
sad
anemones
juno
she
cried
i
am
undone
but
her
lover
consoled
her
and
brought
her
a
bright
casket
of
gold
in
which
lay
some
oval
sugarplums
which
she
partook
a
tear
fell
one
only
a

lenehan

four

yesterday

today
what

on

or
the

the

in

canter
is
still
his
but
let
us
bear
it
as
was
the
ancient
wont
mercy
on
the
luckless
poor

he
said
with
a
light
sigh
she
is
not
the
filly
that
she
was
never
by
this
hand
shall
we
behold
such
another
by

sir
a
queen
of
them
do
you
remember
her
vincent
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
my
queen
today
vincent
said
how
young
she
was
and
radiant
lalage
were
scarce
fair
beside
her
in
her
yellow
shoes
and
frock
of
muslin
i
do
not
know
the
right
name
of
it
the
chestnuts
that
shaded
us
were
in
bloom
the
air
drooped
with
their
persuasive
odour
and
with
pollen
floating
by
us
in
the
sunny
patches
one
might
easily
have
cooked
on
a
stone
a
batch
of
those
buns
with
corinth
fruit
in
them
that
periplipomenes
sells
in
his
booth
near
the
bridge
but
she
had
nought
for
her
teeth
but
the
arm
with
which
i
held
her
and
in
that
she
nibbled
mischievously
when
i
pressed
too
close
a
week
ago
she
lay
ill
four
days
on
the
couch
but
today
she
was
free
blithe
mocked
at
peril
she
is
more
taking
then
her
posies
too
mad
romp
that
she
is
she
had
pulled
her
fill
as
we
reclined
together
and
in
your
ear
my
friend
you
will
not
think
who
met
us
as
we
left
the
field
conmee
himself
he
was
walking
by
the
hedge
reading
i
think
a
brevier
book
with
i
doubt
not
a
witty
letter
in
it
from
glycera
or
chloe
to
keep
the
page
the
sweet
creature
turned
all
colours
in
her
confusion
feigning
to
reprove
a
slight
disorder
in
her
dress
a
slip
of
underwood
clung
there
for
the
very
trees
adore
her
when
conmee
had
passed
she
glanced
at
her
lovely
echo
in
that
little
mirror
she
carries
but
he
had
been
kind
in
going
by
he
had
blessed
us
the
gods
too
are
ever
kind
lenehan
said
if
i
had
poor
luck
with
bass
s
mare
perhaps
this
draught
of
his
may
serve
me
more
propensely
he
was
laying
his
hand
upon
a

saw
it
and
withheld
his

pointing
to
the

and
to

his

is

away
it
is
as
painful
perhaps
to
be
awakened
from
a
vision
as
to
be
born
any

may
be
a

you

stephen
theosophos
told
me
so
stephen
answered
whom
in
a
previous
existence
egyptian
priests
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
karmic
law
the
lords
of
the
moon
theosophos
told
me
an
orangefiery
shipload
from
planet
alpha
of
the
lunar
chain
would
not
assume
the
etheric
doubles
and
these
were
therefore
incarnated
by
the
rubycoloured
egos
from
the
second
constellation
however
as
a
matter
of
fact
though
the
preposterous
surmise
about
him
being
in
some
description
of
a
doldrums
or
other
or
mesmerised
which
was
entirely
due
to
a
misconception
of
the
shallowest
character
was
not
the
case
at
all
the
individual
whose
visual
organs
while
the
above
was
going
on
were
at
this
juncture
commencing
to
exhibit
symptoms
of
animation
was
as
astute
if
not
astuter
than
any
man
living
and
anybody
that
conjectured
the
contrary
would
have
found
themselves
pretty
speedily
in
the
wrong
shop
during
the
past
four
minutes
or
thereabouts
he
had
been
staring
hard
at
a
certain
amount
of
number
one
bass
bottled
by
messrs
bass
and
co
at
which
happened
to
be
situated
amongst
a
lot
of
others
right
opposite
to
where
he
was
and
which
was
certainly
calculated
to
attract
anyone
s
remark
on
account
of
its
scarlet
appearance
he
was
simply
and
solely
as
it
subsequently
transpired
for
reasons
best
known
to
himself
which
put
quite
an
altogether
different
complexion
on
the
proceedings
after
the
moment
before
s
observations
about
boyhood
days
and
the
turf
recollecting
two
or
three
private
transactions
of
his
own
which
the
other
two
were
as
mutually
innocent
of
as
the
babe
unborn
eventually
however
both
their
eyes
met
and
as
soon
as
it
began
to
dawn
on
him
that
the
other
was
endeavouring
to
help
himself
to
the
thing
he
involuntarily
determined
to
help
him
himself
and
so
he
accordingly
took
hold
of
the
neck
of
the
mediumsized
glass
recipient
which
contained
the
fluid
sought
after
and
made
a
capacious
hole
in
it
by
pouring
a
lot
of
it
out
with
also
at
the
same
time
however
a
considerable
degree
of
attentiveness
in
order
not
to
upset
any
of
the
beer
that
was
in
it
about
the
place
the
debate
which
ensued
was
in
its
scope
and
progress
an
epitome
of
the
course
of
life
neither
place
nor
council
was
lacking
in
dignity
the
debaters
were
the
keenest
in
the
land
the
theme
they
were
engaged
on
the
loftiest
and
most
vital
the
high
hall
of
horne
s
house
had
never
beheld
an
assembly
so
representative
and
so
varied
nor
had
the
old
rafters
of
that
establishment
ever
listened
to
a
language
so
encyclopaedic
a
gallant
scene
in
truth
it
made
crotthers
was
there
at
the
foot
of
the
table
in
his
striking
highland
garb
his
face
glowing
from
the
briny
airs
of
the
mull
of
galloway
there
too
opposite
to
him
was
lynch
whose
countenance
bore
already
the
stigmata
of
early
depravity
and
premature
wisdom
next
the
scotchman
was
the
place
assigned
to
costello
the
eccentric
while
at
his
side
was
seated
in
stolid
repose
the
squat
form
of
madden
the
chair
of
the
resident
indeed
stood
vacant
before
the
hearth
but
on
either
flank
of
it
the
figure
of
bannon
in
explorer
s
kit
of
tweed
shorts
and
salted
cowhide
brogues
contrasted
sharply
with
the
primrose
elegance
and
townbred
manners
of
malachi
roland
st
john
mulligan
lastly
at
the
head
of
the
board
was
the
young
poet
who
found
a
refuge
from
his
labours
of
pedagogy
and
metaphysical
inquisition
in
the
convivial
atmosphere
of
socratic
discussion
while
to
right
and
left
of
him
were
accommodated
the
flippant
prognosticator
fresh
from
the
hippodrome
and
that
vigilant
wanderer
soiled
by
the
dust
of
travel
and
combat
and
stained
by
the
mire
of
an
indelible
dishonour
but
from
whose
steadfast
and
constant
heart
no
lure
or
peril
or
threat
or
degradation
could
ever
efface
the
image
of
that
voluptuous
loveliness
which
the
inspired
pencil
of
lafayette
has
limned
for
ages
yet
to
come
it
had
better
be
stated
here
and
now
at
the
outset
that
the
perverted
transcendentalism
to
which
mr
dedalus
div
scep
contentions
would
appear
to
prove
him
pretty
badly
addicted
runs
directly
counter
to
accepted
scientific
methods
science
it
can
not
be
too
often
repeated
deals
with
tangible
phenomena
the
man
of
science
like
the
man
in
the
street
has
to
face
hardheaded
facts
that
can
not
be
blinked
and
explain
them
as
best
he
can
there
may
be
it
is
true
some
questions
which
science
can
not
as
the
first
problem
submitted
by
mr
bloom
pubb
canv
regarding
the
future
determination
of
sex
must
we
accept
the
view
of
empedocles
of
trinacria
that
the
right
ovary
the
postmenstrual
period
assert
others
is
responsible
for
the
birth
of
males
or
are
the
too
long
neglected
spermatozoa
or
nemasperms
the
differentiating
factors
or
is
it
as
most
embryologists
incline
to
opine
such
as
culpepper
spallanzani
blumenbach
lusk
hertwig
leopold
and
valenti
a
mixture
of
both
this
would
be
tantamount
to
a
cooperation
one
of
nature
s
favourite
devices
between
the
nisus
formativus
of
the
nemasperm
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
a
happily
chosen
position
succubitus
felix
of
the
passive
element
the
other
problem
raised
by
the
same
inquirer
is
scarcely
less
vital
infant
mortality
it
is
interesting
because
as
he
pertinently
remarks
we
are
all
born
in
the
same
way
but
we
all
die
in
different
ways
mr
mulligan
hyg
et
eug
doc
blames
the
sanitary
conditions
in
which
our
greylunged
citizens
contract
adenoids
pulmonary
complaints
etc
by
inhaling
the
bacteria
which
lurk
in
dust
these
factors
he
alleged
and
the
revolting
spectacles
offered
by
our
streets
hideous
publicity
posters
religious
ministers
of
all
denominations
mutilated
soldiers
and
sailors
exposed
scorbutic

the
suspended
carcases
of
dead

paranoic
bachelors
and
unfructified

said

accountable
for
any
and
every
fallingoff
in
the
calibre
of
the
race
kalipedia
he
prophesied
would
soon
be
generally
adopted
and
all
the
graces
of

genuinely
good
music
agreeable
literature
light
philosophy
instructive
pictures
plastercast
reproductions
of
the
classical
statues
such
as

apollo
artistic
coloured

all
these
little
attentions
would
enable
ladies
who
were
in
a
particular
condition
to
pass
the
intervening
months
in
a
most
enjoyable
manner
mr
crotthers
disc
bacc
attributes
some
of
these
demises
to
abdominal
trauma
in
the
case
of
women
workers
subjected
to
heavy
labours
in
the
workshop
and
to
marital
discipline
in
the
home
but
by
far
the
vast
majority
to
neglect
private
or
official
culminating
in
the
exposure
of
newborn
infants
the
practice
of
criminal
abortion
or
in
the
atrocious
crime
of
infanticide
although
the
former
we
are
thinking
of
neglect
is
undoubtedly
only
too
true
the
case
he
cites
of
nurses
forgetting
to
count
the
sponges
in
the
peritoneal
cavity
is
too
rare
to
be
normative
in
fact
when
one
comes
to
look
into
it
the
wonder
is
that
so
many
pregnancies
and
deliveries
go
off
so
well
as
they
do
all
things
considered
and
in
spite
of
our
human
shortcomings
which
often
baulk
nature
in
her
intentions
an
ingenious
suggestion
is
that
thrown
out
by
mr
lynch
bacc
arith
that
both
natality
and
mortality
as
well
as
all
other
phenomena
of
evolution
tidal

lunar

in
general
everything

to
a

as

the
plain
straightforward
question
why
a

of
normally
healthy
parents
and
seemingly
a
healthy

properly
looked
after
succumbs
unaccountably
in
early
childhood
though
other
children
of
the
same
marriage
do
not
must
certainly
in
the
poet
s
words
give
us
pause
nature
we
may
rest
assured
has
her
own
good
and
cogent
reasons
for
whatever
she
does
and
in
all
probability
such

are
due
to
some
law
of
anticipation
by
which
organisms
in
which
morbous
germs
have
taken
up
their

modern

conclusively
shown
that

to
disappear
at
an
increasingly
earlier
stage
of

an
arrangement
which
though
productive
of
pain
to
some
of
our
feelings
notably
the
maternal
is
nevertheless
some
of
us

in
the

in

the

of

soothe

on

some

so
embittered
as
to

in
their

with

slowly
forward
over
the

one
by

now
with
a
perhaps
too
conscious
enjoyment
of
the

must

glance
at
whiles
towards
where
his

from

preparatory
to
anything
else
mr
bloom
brushed
off
the
greater
bulk
of
the
shavings
and
handed
stephen
the
hat
and
ashplant
and
bucked
him
up
generally
in
orthodox
samaritan
fashion
which
he
very
badly
needed
his
stephen
s
mind
was
not
exactly
what
you
would
call
wandering
but
a
bit
unsteady
and
on
his
expressed
desire
for
some
beverage
to
drink
mr
bloom
in
view
of
the
hour
it
was
and
there
being
no
pump
of
vartry
water
available
for
their
ablutions
let
alone
drinking
purposes
hit
upon
an
expedient
by
suggesting
off
the
reel
the
propriety
of
the
cabman
s
shelter
as
it
was
called
hardly
a
stonesthrow
away
near
butt
bridge
where
they
might
hit
upon
some
drinkables
in
the
shape
of
a
milk
and
soda
or
a
mineral
but
how
to
get
there
was
the
rub
for
the
nonce
he
was
rather
nonplussed
but
inasmuch
as
the
duty
plainly
devolved
upon
him
to
take
some
measures
on
the
subject
he
pondered
suitable
ways
and
means
during
which
stephen
repeatedly
yawned
so
far
as
he
could
see
he
was
rather
pale
in
the
face
so
that
it
occurred
to
him
as
highly
advisable
to
get
a
conveyance
of
some
description
which
would
answer
in
their
then
condition
both
of
them
being
particularly
stephen
always
assuming
that
there
was
such
a
thing
to
be
found
accordingly
after
a
few
such
preliminaries
as
brushing
in
spite
of
his
having
forgotten
to
take
up
his
rather
soapsuddy
handkerchief
after
it
had
done
yeoman
service
in
the
shaving
line
they
both
walked
together
along
beaver
street
or
more
properly
lane
as
far
as
the
farrier
s
and
the
distinctly
fetid
atmosphere
of
the
livery
stables
at
the
corner
of
montgomery
street
where
they
made
tracks
to
the
left
from
thence
debouching
into
amiens
street
round
by
the
corner
of
dan
bergin
s
but
as
he
confidently
anticipated
there
was
not
a
sign
of
a
jehu
plying
for
hire
anywhere
to
be
seen
except
a
fourwheeler
probably
engaged
by
some
fellows
inside
on
the
spree
outside
the
north
star
hotel
and
there
was
no
symptom
of
its
budging
a
quarter
of
an
inch
when
mr
bloom
who
was
anything
but
a
professional
whistler
endeavoured
to
hail
it
by
emitting
a
kind
of
a
whistle
holding
his
arms
arched
over
his
head
twice
this
was
a
quandary
but
bringing
common
sense
to
bear
on
it
evidently
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
put
a
good
face
on
the
matter
and
foot
it
which
they
accordingly
did
so
bevelling
around
by
mullett
s
and
the
signal
house
which
they
shortly
reached
they
proceeded
perforce
in
the
direction
of
amiens
street
railway
terminus
mr
bloom
being
handicapped
by
the
circumstance
that
one
of
the
back
buttons
of
his
trousers
had
to
vary
the
timehonoured
adage
gone
the
way
of
all
buttons
though
entering
thoroughly
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
he
heroically
made
light
of
the
mischance
so
as
neither
of
them
were
particularly
pressed
for
time
as
it
happened
and
the
temperature
refreshing
since
it
cleared
up
after
the
recent
visitation
of
jupiter
pluvius
they
dandered
along
past
by
where
the
empty
vehicle
was
waiting
without
a
fare
or
a
jarvey
as
it
so
happened
a
dublin
united
tramways
company
s
sandstrewer
happened
to
be
returning
and
the
elder
man
recounted
to
his
companion
à
propos
of
the
incident
his
own
truly
miraculous
escape
of
some
little
while
back
they
passed
the
main
entrance
of
the
great
northern
railway
station
the
starting
point
for
belfast
where
of
course
all
traffic
was
suspended
at
that
late
hour
and
passing
the
backdoor
of
the
morgue
a
not
very
enticing
locality
not
to
say
gruesome
to
a
degree
more
especially
at
night
ultimately
gained
the
dock
tavern
and
in
due
course
turned
into
store
street
famous
for
its
c
division
police
station
between
this
point
and
the
high
at
present
unlit
warehouses
of
beresford
place
stephen
thought
to
think
of
ibsen
associated
with
baird
s
the
stonecutter
s
in
his
mind
somehow
in
talbot
place
first
turning
on
the
right
while
the
other
who
was
acting
as
his
fidus
achates
inhaled
with
internal
satisfaction
the
smell
of
james
rourke
s
city
bakery
situated
quite
close
to
where
they
were
the
very
palatable
odour
indeed
of
our
daily
bread
of
all
commodities
of
the
public
the
primary
and
most
indispensable
bread
the
staff
of
life
earn
your
bread
o
tell
me
where
is
fancy
bread
at
rourke
s
the
baker
s
it
is
said
en
route
to
his
taciturn
and
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
on
it
not
yet
perfectly
sober
companion
mr
bloom
who
at
all
events
was
in
complete
possession
of
his
faculties
never
more
so
in
fact
disgustingly
sober
spoke
a
word
of
caution
re
the
dangers
of
nighttown
women
of
ill
fame
and
swell
mobsmen
which
barely
permissible
once
in
a
while
though
not
as
a
habitual
practice
was
of
the
nature
of
a
regular
deathtrap
for
young
fellows
of
his
age
particularly
if
they
had
acquired
drinking
habits
under
the
influence
of
liquor
unless
you
knew
a
little
jiujitsu
for
every
contingency
as
even
a
fellow
on
the
broad
of
his
back
could
administer
a
nasty
kick
if
you
didn
t
look
out
highly
providential
was
the
appearance
on
the
scene
of
corny
kelleher
when
stephen
was
blissfully
unconscious
but
for
that
man
in
the
gap
turning
up
at
the
eleventh
hour
the
finis
might
have
been
that
he
might
have
been
a
candidate
for
the
accident
ward
or
failing
that
the
bridewell
and
an
appearance
in
the
court
next
day
before
mr
tobias
or
he
being
the
solicitor
rather
old
wall
he
meant
to
say
or
mahony
which
simply
spelt
ruin
for
a
chap
when
it
got
bruited
about
the
reason
he
mentioned
the
fact
was
that
a
lot
of
those
policemen
whom
he
cordially
disliked
were
admittedly
unscrupulous
in
the
service
of
the
crown
and
as
mr
bloom
put
it
recalling
a
case
or
two
in
the
a
division
in
clanbrassil
street
prepared
to
swear
a
hole
through
a
ten
gallon
pot
never
on
the
spot
when
wanted
but
in
quiet
parts
of
the
city
pembroke
road
for
example
the
guardians
of
the
law
were
well
in
evidence
the
obvious
reason
being
they
were
paid
to
protect
the
upper
classes
another
thing
he
commented
on
was
equipping
soldiers
with
firearms
or
sidearms
of
any
description
liable
to
go
off
at
any
time
which
was
tantamount
to
inciting
them
against
civilians
should
by
any
chance
they
fall
out
over
anything
you
frittered
away
your
time
he
very
sensibly
maintained
and
health
and
also
character
besides
which
the
squandermania
of
the
thing
fast
women
of
the
demimonde
ran
away
with
a
lot
of
into
the
bargain
and
the
greatest
danger
of
all
was
who
you
got
drunk
with
though
touching
the
much
vexed
question
of
stimulants
he
relished
a
glass
of
choice
old
wine
in
season
as
both
nourishing
and
bloodmaking
and
possessing
aperient
virtues
notably
a
good
burgundy
which
he
was
a
staunch
believer
in
still
never
beyond
a
certain
point
where
he
invariably
drew
the
line
as
it
simply
led
to
trouble
all
round
to
say
nothing
of
your
being
at
the
tender
mercy
of
others
practically
most
of
all
he
commented
adversely
on
the
desertion
of
stephen
by
all
his
pubhunting
confrères
but
one
a
most
glaring
piece
of
ratting
on
the
part
of
his
brother
medicos
under
all
the
circs
that
one
was
judas
stephen
said
who
up
to
then
had
said
nothing
whatsoever
of
any
kind
discussing
these
and
kindred
topics
they
made
a
beeline
across
the
back
of
the
customhouse
and
passed
under
the
loop
line
bridge
where
a
brazier
of
coke
burning
in
front
of
a
sentrybox
or
something
like
one
attracted
their
rather
lagging
footsteps
stephen
of
his
own
accord
stopped
for
no
special
reason
to
look
at
the
heap
of
barren
cobblestones
and
by
the
light
emanating
from
the
brazier
he
could
just
make
out
the
darker
figure
of
the
corporation
watchman
inside
the
gloom
of
the
sentrybox
he
began
to
remember
that
this
had
happened
or
had
been
mentioned
as
having
happened
before
but
it
cost
him
no
small
effort
before
he
remembered
that
he
recognised
in
the
sentry
a
quondam
friend
of
his
father
s
gumley
to
avoid
a
meeting
he
drew
nearer
to
the
pillars
of
the
railway
bridge
saluted
you
mr
bloom
said
a
figure
of
middle
height
on
the
prowl
evidently
under
the
arches
saluted
again
calling
stephen
of
course
started
rather
dizzily
and
stopped
to
return
the
compliment
mr
bloom
actuated
by
motives
of
inherent
delicacy
inasmuch
as
he
always
believed
in
minding
his
own
business
moved
off
but
nevertheless
remained
on
the
qui
vive
with
just
a
shade
of
anxiety
though
not
funkyish
in
the
least
though
unusual
in
the
dublin
area
he
knew
that
it
was
not
by
any
means
unknown
for
desperadoes
who
had
next
to
nothing
to
live
on
to
be
abroad
waylaying
and
generally
terrorising
peaceable
pedestrians
by
placing
a
pistol
at
their
head
in
some
secluded
spot
outside
the
city
proper
famished
loiterers
of
the
thames
embankment
category
they
might
be
hanging
about
there
or
simply
marauders
ready
to
decamp
with
whatever
boodle
they
could
in
one
fell
swoop
at
a
moment
s
notice
your
money
or
your
life
leaving
you
there
to
point
a
moral
gagged
and
garrotted
stephen
that
is
when
the
accosting
figure
came
to
close
quarters
though
he
was
not
in
an
over
sober
state
himself
recognised
corley
s
breath
redolent
of
rotten
cornjuice
lord
john
corley
some
called
him
and
his
genealogy
came
about
in
this
wise
he
was
the
eldest
son
of
inspector
corley
of
the
g
division
lately
deceased
who
had
married
a
certain
katherine
brophy
the
daughter
of
a
louth
farmer
his
grandfather
patrick
michael
corley
of
new
ross
had
married
the
widow
of
a
publican
there
whose
maiden
name
had
been
katherine
also
talbot
rumour
had
it
though
not
proved
that
she
descended
from
the
house
of
the
lords
talbot
de
malahide
in
whose
mansion
really
an
unquestionably
fine
residence
of
its
kind
and
well
worth
seeing
her
mother
or
aunt
or
some
relative
a
woman
as
the
tale
went
of
extreme
beauty
had
enjoyed
the
distinction
of
being
in
service
in
the
washkitchen
this
therefore
was
the
reason
why
the
still
comparatively
young
though
dissolute
man
who
now
addressed
stephen
was
spoken
of
by
some
with
facetious
proclivities
as
lord
john
corley
taking
stephen
on
one
side
he
had
the
customary
doleful
ditty
to
tell
not
as
much
as
a
farthing
to
purchase
a
night
s
lodgings
his
friends
had
all
deserted
him
furthermore
he
had
a
row
with
lenehan
and
called
him
to
stephen
a
mean
bloody
swab
with
a
sprinkling
of
a
number
of
other
uncalledfor
expressions
he
was
out
of
a
job
and
implored
of
stephen
to
tell
him
where
on
god
s
earth
he
could
get
something
anything
at
all
to
do
no
it
was
the
daughter
of
the
mother
in
the
washkitchen
that
was
fostersister
to
the
heir
of
the
house
or
else
they
were
connected
through
the
mother
in
some
way
both
occurrences
happening
at
the
same
time
if
the
whole
thing
wasn
t
a
complete
fabrication
from
start
to
finish
anyhow
he
was
all
in
wouldn
t
ask
you
only
pursued
he
on
my
solemn
oath
and
god
knows
i
m
on
the
rocks
ll
be
a
job
tomorrow
or
next
day
stephen
told
him
in
a
boys
school
at
dalkey
for
a
gentleman
usher
mr
garrett
deasy
try
it
you
may
mention
my
name
god
corley
replied
sure
i
couldn
t
teach
in
a
school
man
i
was
never
one
of
your
bright
ones
he
added
with
a
half
laugh
i
got
stuck
twice
in
the
junior
at
the
christian
brothers
have
no
place
to
sleep
myself
stephen
informed
him
corley
at
the
first
was
inclined
to
suspect
it
was
something
to
do
with
stephen
being
fired
out
of
his
digs
for
bringing
in
a
bloody
tart
off
the
street
there
was
a
dosshouse
in
marlborough
street
mrs
maloney
s
but
it
was
only
a
tanner
touch
and
full
of
undesirables
but
m
conachie
told
him
you
got
a
decent
enough
do
in
the
brazen
head
over
in
winetavern
street
which
was
distantly
suggestive
to
the
person
addressed
of
friar
bacon
for
a
bob
he
was
starving
too
though
he
hadn
t
said
a
word
about
it
though
this
sort
of
thing
went
on
every
other
night
or
very
near
it
still
stephen
s
feelings
got
the
better
of
him
in
a
sense
though
he
knew
that
corley
s
brandnew
rigmarole
on
a
par
with
the
others
was
hardly
deserving
of
much
credence
however
haud
ignarus
malorum
miseris
succurrere
disco
etcetera
as
the
latin
poet
remarks
especially
as
luck
would
have
it
he
got
paid
his
screw
after
every
middle
of
the
month
on
the
sixteenth
which
was
the
date
of
the
month
as
a
matter
of
fact
though
a
good
bit
of
the
wherewithal
was
demolished
but
the
cream
of
the
joke
was
nothing
would
get
it
out
of
corley
s
head
that
he
was
living
in
affluence
and
hadn
t
a
thing
to
do
but
hand
out
the
needful
whereas
he
put
his
hand
in
a
pocket
anyhow
not
with
the
idea
of
finding
any
food
there
but
thinking
he
might
lend
him
anything
up
to
a
bob
or
so
in
lieu
so
that
he
might
endeavour
at
all
events
and
get
sufficient
to
eat
but
the
result
was
in
the
negative
for
to
his
chagrin
he
found
his
cash
missing
a
few
broken
biscuits
were
all
the
result
of
his
investigation
he
tried
his
hardest
to
recollect
for
the
moment
whether
he
had
lost
as
well
he
might
have
or
left
because
in
that
contingency
it
was
not
a
pleasant
lookout
very
much
the
reverse
in
fact
he
was
altogether
too
fagged
out
to
institute
a
thorough
search
though
he
tried
to
recollect
about
biscuits
he
dimly
remembered
who
now
exactly
gave
them
he
wondered
or
where
was
or
did
he
buy
however
in
another
pocket
he
came
across
what
he
surmised
in
the
dark
were
pennies
erroneously
however
as
it
turned
out
are
halfcrowns
man
corley
corrected
him
and
so
in
point
of
fact
they
turned
out
to
be
stephen
anyhow
lent
him
one
of
them
corley
answered
you
re
a
gentleman
i
ll
pay
you
back
one
time
who
s
that
with
you
i
saw
him
a
few
times
in
the
bleeding
horse
in
camden
street
with
boylan
the
billsticker
you
might
put
in
a
good
word
for
us
to
get
me
taken
on
there
i
d
carry
a
sandwichboard
only
the
girl
in
the
office
told
me
they
re
full
up
for
the
next
three
weeks
man
god
you
ve
to
book
ahead
man
you
d
think
it
was
for
the
carl
rosa
i
don
t
give
a
shite
anyway
so
long
as
i
get
a
job
even
as
a
crossing
sweeper
subsequently
being
not
quite
so
down
in
the
mouth
after
the
two
and
six
he
got
he
informed
stephen
about
a
fellow
by
the
name
of
bags
comisky
that
he
said
stephen
knew
well
out
of
fullam
s
the
shipchandler
s
bookkeeper
there
that
used
to
be
often
round
in
nagle
s
back
with
o
mara
and
a
little
chap
with
a
stutter
the
name
of
tighe
anyhow
he
was
lagged
the
night
before
last
and
fined
ten
bob
for
a
drunk
and
disorderly
and
refusing
to
go
with
the
constable
mr
bloom
in
the
meanwhile
kept
dodging
about
in
the
vicinity
of
the
cobblestones
near
the
brazier
of
coke
in
front
of
the
corporation
watchman
s
sentrybox
who
evidently
a
glutton
for
work
it
struck
him
was
having
a
quiet
forty
winks
for
all
intents
and
purposes
on
his
own
private
account
while
dublin
slept
he
threw
an
odd
eye
at
the
same
time
now
and
then
at
stephen
s
anything
but
immaculately
attired
interlocutor
as
if
he
had
seen
that
nobleman
somewhere
or
other
though
where
he
was
not
in
a
position
to
truthfully
state
nor
had
he
the
remotest
idea
when
being
a
levelheaded
individual
who
could
give
points
to
not
a
few
in
point
of
shrewd
observation
he
also
remarked
on
his
very
dilapidated
hat
and
slouchy
wearing
apparel
generally
testifying
to
a
chronic
impecuniosity
palpably
he
was
one
of
his
hangerson
but
for
the
matter
of
that
it
was
merely
a
question
of
one
preying
on
his
nextdoor
neighbour
all
round
in
every
deep
so
to
put
it
a
deeper
depth
and
for
the
matter
of
that
if
the
man
in
the
street
chanced
to
be
in
the
dock
himself
penal
servitude
with
or
without
the
option
of
a
fine
would
be
a
very
rara
avis
altogether
in
any
case
he
had
a
consummate
amount
of
cool
assurance
intercepting
people
at
that
hour
of
the
night
or
morning
pretty
thick
that
was
certainly
the
pair
parted
company
and
stephen
rejoined
mr
bloom
who
with
his
practised
eye
was
not
without
perceiving
that
he
had
succumbed
to
the
blandiloquence
of
the
other
parasite
alluding
to
the
encounter
he
said
laughingly
stephen
that
is
is
down
on
his
luck
he
asked
me
to
ask
you
to
ask
somebody
named
boylan
a
billsticker
to
give
him
a
job
as
a
sandwichman
at
this
intelligence
in
which
he
seemingly
evinced
little
interest
mr
bloom
gazed
abstractedly
for
the
space
of
a
half
a
second
or
so
in
the
direction
of
a
bucketdredger
rejoicing
in
the
farfamed
name
of
eblana
moored
alongside
customhouse
quay
and
quite
possibly
out
of
repair
whereupon
he
observed
evasively
gets
their
own
ration
of
luck
they
say
now
you
mention
it
his
face
was
familiar
to
me
but
leaving
that
for
the
moment
how
much
did
you
part
with
he
queried
if
i
am
not
too
inquisitive
a
crown
stephen
responded
i
daresay
he
needs
it
to
sleep
somewhere
mr
bloom
ejaculated
professing
not
the
least
surprise
at
the
intelligence
i
can
quite
credit
the
assertion
and
i
guarantee
he
invariably
does
everyone
according
to
his
needs
or
everyone
according
to
his
deeds
but
talking
about
things
in
general
where
added
he
with
a
smile
will
you
sleep
yourself
walking
to
sandycove
is
out
of
the
question
and
even
supposing
you
did
you
won
t
get
in
after
what
occurred
at
westland
row
station
simply
fag
out
there
for
nothing
i
don
t
mean
to
presume
to
dictate
to
you
in
the
slightest
degree
but
why
did
you
leave
your
father
s
house
seek
misfortune
was
stephen
s
answer
met
your
respected
father
on
a
recent
occasion
mr
bloom
diplomatically
returned
today
in
fact
or
to
be
strictly
accurate
on
yesterday
where
does
he
live
at
present
i
gathered
in
the
course
of
conversation
that
he
had
moved
believe
he
is
in
dublin
somewhere
stephen
answered
unconcernedly
why
gifted
man
mr
bloom
said
of
mr
dedalus
senior
in
more
respects
than
one
and
a
born
raconteur
if
ever
there
was
one
he
takes
great
pride
quite
legitimate
out
of
you
you
could
go
back
perhaps
he
hasarded
still
thinking
of
the
very
unpleasant
scene
at
westland
row
terminus
when
it
was
perfectly
evident
that
the
other
two
mulligan
that
is
and
that
english
tourist
friend
of
his
who
eventually
euchred
their
third
companion
were
patently
trying
as
if
the
whole
bally
station
belonged
to
them
to
give
stephen
the
slip
in
the
confusion
which
they
did
there
was
no
response
forthcoming
to
the
suggestion
however
such
as
it
was
stephen
s
mind
s
eye
being
too
busily
engaged
in
repicturing
his
family
hearth
the
last
time
he
saw
it
with
his
sister
dilly
sitting
by
the
ingle
her
hair
hanging
down
waiting
for
some
weak
trinidad
shell
cocoa
that
was
in
the
sootcoated
kettle
to
be
done
so
that
she
and
he
could
drink
it
with
the
oatmealwater
for
milk
after
the
friday
herrings
they
had
eaten
at
two
a
penny
with
an
egg
apiece
for
maggy
boody
and
katey
the
cat
meanwhile
under
the
mangle
devouring
a
mess
of
eggshells
and
charred
fish
heads
and
bones
on
a
square
of
brown
paper
in
accordance
with
the
third
precept
of
the
church
to
fast
and
abstain
on
the
days
commanded
it
being
quarter
tense
or
if
not
ember
days
or
something
like
that
mr
bloom
repeated
again
i
wouldn
t
personally
repose
much
trust
in
that
boon
companion
of
yours
who
contributes
the
humorous
element
dr
mulligan
as
a
guide
philosopher
and
friend
if
i
were
in
your
shoes
he
knows
which
side
his
bread
is
buttered
on
though
in
all
probability
he
never
realised
what
it
is
to
be
without
regular
meals
of
course
you
didn
t
notice
as
much
as
i
did
but
it
wouldn
t
occasion
me
the
least
surprise
to
learn
that
a
pinch
of
tobacco
or
some
narcotic
was
put
in
your
drink
for
some
ulterior
object
he
understood
however
from
all
he
heard
that
dr
mulligan
was
a
versatile
allround
man
by
no
means
confined
to
medicine
only
who
was
rapidly
coming
to
the
fore
in
his
line
and
if
the
report
was
verified
bade
fair
to
enjoy
a
flourishing
practice
in
the
not
too
distant
future
as
a
tony
medical
practitioner
drawing
a
handsome
fee
for
his
services
in
addition
to
which
professional
status
his
rescue
of
that
man
from
certain
drowning
by
artificial
respiration
and
what
they
call
first
aid
at
skerries
or
malahide
was
it
was
he
was
bound
to
admit
an
exceedingly
plucky
deed
which
he
could
not
too
highly
praise
so
that
frankly
he
was
utterly
at
a
loss
to
fathom
what
earthly
reason
could
be
at
the
back
of
it
except
he
put
it
down
to
sheer
cussedness
or
jealousy
pure
and
simple
it
simply
amounts
to
one
thing
and
he
is
what
they
call
picking
your
brains
he
ventured
to
throw
out
the
guarded
glance
of
half
solicitude
half
curiosity
augmented
by
friendliness
which
he
gave
at
stephen
s
at
present
morose
expression
of
features
did
not
throw
a
flood
of
light
none
at
all
in
fact
on
the
problem
as
to
whether
he
had
let
himself
be
badly
bamboozled
to
judge
by
two
or
three
lowspirited
remarks
he
let
drop
or
the
other
way
about
saw
through
the
affair
and
for
some
reason
or
other
best
known
to
himself
allowed
matters
to
more
or
less
grinding
poverty
did
have
that
effect
and
he
more
than
conjectured
that
high
educational
abilities
though
he
possessed
he
experienced
no
little
difficulty
in
making
both
ends
meet
adjacent
to
the
men
s
public
urinal
they
perceived
an
icecream
car
round
which
a
group
of
presumably
italians
in
heated
altercation
were
getting
rid
of
voluble
expressions
in
their
vivacious
language
in
a
particularly
animated
way
there
being
some
little
differences
between
the
parties

mr
bloom
and
stephen
entered
the
cabman
s
shelter
an
unpretentious
wooden
structure
where
prior
to
then
he
had
rarely
if
ever
been
before
the
former
having
previously
whispered
to
the
latter
a
few
hints
anent
the
keeper
of
it
said
to
be
the
once
famous
fitzharris
the
invincible
though
he
could
not
vouch
for
the
actual
facts
which
quite
possibly
there
was
not
one
vestige
of
truth
in
a
few
moments
later
saw
our
two
noctambules
safely
seated
in
a
discreet
corner
only
to
be
greeted
by
stares
from
the
decidedly
miscellaneous
collection
of
waifs
and
strays
and
other
nondescript
specimens
of
the
genus
homo
already
there
engaged
in
eating
and
drinking
diversified
by
conversation
for
whom
they
seemingly
formed
an
object
of
marked
curiosity
touching
a
cup
of
coffee
mr
bloom
ventured
to
plausibly
suggest
to
break
the
ice
it
occurs
to
me
you
ought
to
sample
something
in
the
shape
of
solid
food
say
a
roll
of
some
description
accordingly
his
first
act
was
with
characteristic
sangfroid
to
order
these
commodities
quietly
the
hoi
polloi
of
jarvies
or
stevedores
or
whatever
they
were
after
a
cursory
examination
turned
their
eyes
apparently
dissatisfied
away
though
one
redbearded
bibulous
individual
portion
of
whose
hair
was
greyish
a
sailor
probably
still
stared
for
some
appreciable
time
before
transferring
his
rapt
attention
to
the
floor
mr
bloom
availing
himself
of
the
right
of
free
speech
he
having
just
a
bowing
acquaintance
with
the
language
in
dispute
though
to
be
sure
rather
in
a
quandary
over
voglio
remarked
to
his
protégé
in
an
audible
tone
of
voice
à
propos
of
the
battle
royal
in
the
street
which
was
still
raging
fast
and
furious

stephen
who
was
trying
his
dead
best
to
yawn
if
he
could
suffering
from
lassitude
generally
replied
fill
the
ear
of
a
cow
elephant
they
were
haggling
over
money
that
so
mr
bloom
asked
of
course
he
subjoined
pensively
at
the
inward
reflection
of
there
being
more
languages
to
start
with
than
were
absolutely
necessary
it
may
be
only
the
southern
glamour
that
surrounds
it
the
keeper
of
the
shelter
in
the
middle
of
this
put
a
boiling
swimming
cup
of
a
choice
concoction
labelled
coffee
on
the
table
and
a
rather
antediluvian
specimen
of
a
bun
or
so
it
seemed
after
which
he
beat
a
retreat
to
his
counter
mr
bloom
determining
to
have
a
good
square
look
at
him
later
on
so
as
not
to
appear
to
for
which
reason
he
encouraged
stephen
to
proceed
with
his
eyes
while
he
did
the
honours
by
surreptitiously
pushing
the
cup
of
what
was
temporarily
supposed
to
be
called
coffee
gradually
nearer
him
are
impostures
stephen
said
after
a
pause
of
some
little
time
like
names
cicero
podmore
napoleon
mr
goodbody
jesus
mr
doyle
shakespeares
were
as
common
as
murphies
what
s
in
a
name
to
be
sure
mr
bloom
unaffectedly
concurred
of
course
our
name
was
changed
too
he
added
pushing
the
socalled
roll
across
the
redbearded
sailor
who
had
his
weather
eye
on
the
newcomers
boarded
stephen
whom
he
had
singled
out
for
attention
in
particular
squarely
by
asking
what
might
your
name
be
just
in
the
nick
of
time
mr
bloom
touched
his
companion
s
boot
but
stephen
apparently
disregarding
the
warm
pressure
from
an
unexpected
quarter
answered
the
sailor
stared
at
him
heavily
from
a
pair
of
drowsy
baggy
eyes
rather
bunged
up
from
excessive
use
of
boose
preferably
good
old
hollands
and
water
know
simon
dedalus
he
asked
at
length
ve
heard
of
him
stephen
said
mr
bloom
was
all
at
sea
for
a
moment
seeing
the
others
evidently
eavesdropping
too
s
irish
the
seaman
bold
affirmed
staring
still
in
much
the
same
way
and
nodding
all
irish
too
irish
stephen
rejoined
as
for
mr
bloom
he
could
neither
make
head
or
tail
of
the
whole
business
and
he
was
just
asking
himself
what
possible
connection
when
the
sailor
of
his
own
accord
turned
to
the
other
occupants
of
the
shelter
with
the
remark
seen
him
shoot
two
eggs
off
two
bottles
at
fifty
yards
over
his
shoulder
the
lefthand
dead
shot
though
he
was
slightly
hampered
by
an
occasional
stammer
and
his
gestures
being
also
clumsy
as
it
was
still
he
did
his
best
to
explain
out
there
say
fifty
yards
measured
eggs
on
the
bottles
cocks
his
gun
over
his
shoulder
aims
he
turned
his
body
half
round
shut
up
his
right
eye
completely
then
he
screwed
his
features
up
someway
sideways
and
glared
out
into
the
night
with
an
unprepossessing
cast
of
countenance
he
then
shouted
once
the
entire
audience
waited
anticipating
an
additional
detonation
there
being
still
a
further
egg
he
shouted
twice
egg
two
evidently
demolished
he
nodded
and
winked
adding
bloodthirstily
bill
shoots
to
kill
never
missed
nor
he
never
will
a
silence
ensued
till
mr
bloom
for
agreeableness
sake
just
felt
like
asking
him
whether
it
was
for
a
marksmanship
competition
like
the
bisley
pardon
the
sailor
said
ago
mr
bloom
pursued
without
flinching
a
hairsbreadth
the
sailor
replied
relaxing
to
a
certain
extent
under
the
magic
influence
of
diamond

it
might
be
a

the

who
scarcely

turned
to
one
of

with
the
request

took
a

hanging
on
a

and
the
desired
object
was
passed
from

in

the

depicted
in

on
which
occasion
the

passed
through
the

having
detected
a
discrepancy
between
his

assuming
he
was
the
person
he
represented
himself
to
be

not
sailing
under
false
colours
after
having
boxed

the
fictitious

of

made
him
nourish
some
suspicions
of

it
reminded
him
in

of
a
longcherished
plan
he
meant
to
one
day
realise
some
wednesday
or
saturday
of
travelling
to
london
via
long
sea
not
to
say
that
he
had
ever
travelled
extensively
to
any
great
extent
but
he
was
at
heart
a
born
adventurer
though
by
a
trick
of
fate
he
had
consistently
remained
a
landlubber
except
you
call
going
to
holyhead
which
was
his
longest
martin
cunningham
frequently
said
he
would
work
a
pass
through

but
some
deuced
hitch
or
other
eternally
cropped
up
with
the
net
result
that
the
scheme
fell
through
but
even
suppose
it
did
come
to
planking
down
the
needful
and
breaking
boyd

heart
it
was
not
so
dear
purse
permitting
a
few
guineas
at
the
outside
considering
the
fare
to
mullingar
where
he
figured
on
going
was
five
and
six
there
and
back
the
trip
would
benefit
health
on
account
of
the
bracing
ozone
and
be
in
every
way
thoroughly
pleasurable
especially
for
a
chap
whose
liver
was
out
of
order
seeing
the
different
places
along
the
route
plymouth
falmouth
southampton
and
so
on
culminating
in
an
instructive
tour
of
the
sights
of
the
great
metropolis
the
spectacle
of
our
modern
babylon
where
doubtless
he
would
see
the
greatest
improvement

of

to
renew
acquaintance
with

just
struck
him
as
a

no

bad
notion
was
he
might
have
a
gaze
around
on
the

about

quite
sanguine

of

could

and
thus
combine

with

but
who
that
was
the
rub
also
without
being
actually

it
struck
him
a
great
field
was
to
be
opened
up
in
the
line
of
opening
up
new
routes
to
keep

a
great
opportunity
there
certainly
was
for

and
enterprise
to
meet
the
travelling
needs
of
the
public
at
large
the
average
man
brown
robinson
and
co
it
was
a
subject
of
regret
and
absurd
as
well
on
the
face
of
it
and
no
small
blame
to
our
vaunted
society
that
the
man
in
the
street
when
the
system
really
needed
toning
up
for
the
matter
of
a
couple
of
paltry
pounds
was
debarred
from
seeing
more
of
the
world
they
lived
in
instead
of
being
always
and
ever
cooped
up
since
my
old
took
me
for
a
wife
after
all
hang
it
they
had
their
eleven
and
more
humdrum
months
of
it

merited
a
radical
change

excellent

delightful

offering
a

as
well
as

for
the

dublin
and
its
picturesque
environs
even
poulaphouca
to
which
there
was
a

but
also
farther
away
from
the

in

rightly
termed

an
ideal
neighbourhood
for

so
long
as
it
didn

come
down

in

of

where
if
report
spoke
true
the
coup
d

was
exceedingly
grand
though
the
lastnamed
locality
was
not
easily
getatable
so
that
the

of
visitors
was
not
as
yet

that
it
might
be

the

of

in
the

when
young

fancy
though

had
its

toll
of
deaths
by
falling
off
the
cliffs
by
design
or
accidentally
usually
by
the
way
on
their
left
leg
it
being
only
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour

run
from
the

because

uptodate
tourist
travelling
was
as
yet
merely
in
its
infancy
so
to
speak
and
the
accommodation
left
much
to
be
desired
interesting
to
fathom
it
seemed
to
him
from
a
motive
of
curiosity
pure
and
simple
was
whether
it
was
the
traffic
that
created
the
route
or
viceversa
or
the
two
sides
in
fact
he
turned
back
the
other
side
of
the

and
passed
it
along
to
stephen

related
the
doughty

that
had
little
pills
like
putty
and
he
put
them
in

and
they
opened
and
every
pill
was
something
different
one
was
a
ship
another
was
a

another
was

appetisingly
added
the
chinks

possibly
perceiving
an
expression
of
dubiosity
on
their
faces
the
globetrotter
went
on
adhering
to
his
adventures
i
seen
a
man
killed
in
trieste
by
an
italian
chap
knife
in
his
back
knife
like
that
whilst
speaking
he
produced
a
dangerouslooking
claspknife
quite
in
keeping
with
his
character
and
held
it
in
the
striking
position

a

repeated
he
examining
his
formidable
stiletto
after
which
harrowing
dénouement
sufficient
to
appal
the
stoutest
he
snapped
the
blade
to
and
stowed
the
weapon
in

away
as
before
in
his
chamber
of

re

for

somebody
who
was
evidently
quite
in
the
dark

for
the
benefit
of

all
that
was
why
they
thought
the

done
by

on

at
this
remark
passed
obviously
in
the
spirit
of
where
ignorance
is
bliss
mr

stephen
each
in
his
own
particular
way
both
instinctively
exchanged
meaning
glances
in
a
religious
silence
of
the
strictly
entre

variety
however
towards
where
alias
the
keeper
not
turning
a
hair
was
drawing
spurts
of
liquid
from
his
boiler
affair
his
inscrutable
face
which
was
really
a
work
of
art
a
perfect
study
in
itself
beggaring
description
conveyed
the
impression
that
he
didn

understand
one
jot
of
what
was
going
on
funny
very
there
ensued
a
somewhat
lengthy
pause
one
man
was
reading
in
fits

the
seaman
s
discharge
mr
bloom
so
far
as
he
was
personally
concerned
was
just
pondering
in
pensive
mood
he
vividly
recollected
when
the
occurrence
alluded
to
took
place
as
well
as
yesterday
roughly
some
score
of
years
previously
in
the
days
of
the
land
troubles
when
it
took
the
civilised
world
by
storm
figuratively
speaking
early
in
the
eighties
eightyone
to
be
correct
when
he
was
just
turned
fifteen
boss
the
sailor
broke
in
give
us
back
them
papers
the
request
being
complied
with
he
clawed
them
up
with
a
scrape
you
seen
the
rock
of
gibraltar
mr
bloom
inquired
the
sailor
grimaced
chewing
in
a
way
that
might
be
read
as
yes
ay
or
no
you
ve
touched
there
too
mr
bloom
said
europa
point
thinking
he
had
in
the
hope
that
the
rover
might
possibly
by
some
reminiscences
but
he
failed
to
do
so
simply
letting
spirt
a
jet
of
spew
into
the
sawdust
and
shook
his
head
with
a
sort
of
lazy
scorn
year
would
that
be
about
mr
b
interrogated
can
you
recall
the
boats
our
sailor
munched
heavily
awhile
hungrily
before
answering
m
tired
of
all
them
rocks
in
the
sea
he
said
and
boats
and
ships
salt
junk
all
the
time
tired
seemingly
he
ceased
his
questioner
perceiving
that
he
was
not
likely
to
get
a
great
deal
of
change
out
of
such
a
wily
old
customer
fell
to
woolgathering
on
the
enormous
dimensions
of
the
water
about
the
globe
suffice
it
to
say
that
as
a
casual
glance
at
the
map
revealed
it
covered
fully
three
fourths
of
it
and
he
fully
realised
accordingly
what
it
meant
to
rule
the
waves
on
more
than
one
occasion
a
dozen
at
the
lowest
near
the
north
bull
at
dollymount
he
had
remarked
a
superannuated
old
salt
evidently
derelict
seated
habitually
near
the
not
particularly
redolent
sea
on
the
wall
staring
quite
obliviously
at
it
and
it
at
him
dreaming
of
fresh
woods
and
pastures
new
as
someone
somewhere
sings
and
it
left
him
wondering
why
possibly
he
had
tried
to
find
out
the
secret
for
himself
floundering
up
and
down
the
antipodes
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
over
and
under
well
not
exactly
under
tempting
the
fates
and
the
odds
were
twenty
to
nil
there
was
really
no
secret
about
it
at
all
nevertheless
without
going
into
the
minutiae
of
the
business
the
eloquent
fact
remained
that
the
sea
was
there
in
all
its
glory
and
in
the
natural
course
of
things
somebody
or
other
had
to
sail
on
it
and
fly
in
the
face
of
providence
though
it
merely
went
to
show
how
people
usually
contrived
to
load
that
sort
of
onus
on
to
the
other
fellow
like
the
hell
idea
and
the
lottery
and
insurance
which
were
run
on
identically
the
same
lines
so
that
for
that
very
reason
if
no
other
lifeboat
sunday
was
a
highly
laudable
institution
to
which
the
public
at
large
no
matter
where
living
inland
or
seaside
as
the
case
might
be
having
it
brought
home
to
them
like
that
should
extend
its
gratitude
also
to
the
harbourmasters
and
coastguard
service
who
had
to
man
the
rigging
and
push
off
and
out
amid
the
elements
whatever
the
season
when
duty
called
ireland
expects
that
every
man
and
so
on
and
sometimes
had
a
terrible
time
of
it
in
the
wintertime
not
forgetting
the
irish
lights

and
others
liable
to
capsize
at
any
moment

with

in

dragged
his

open
so
that
on

of
the
timehonoured
symbol
of
the

they
had
a

view
of

squeezing
or
here
he
said
showing
antonio
there
he
is
cursing
the
mate
and
there
he
is
now
he
added
the
same
fellow
pulling
the
skin
with
his
fingers
some
special
knack
evidently
and
he
laughing
at
a
yarn
and
in
point
of
fact
the
young
man
named
antonio
s
livid
face
did
actually
look
like
forced
smiling
and
the
curious
effect
excited
the
unreserved
admiration
of
everybody
including
who
this
time
stretched
over
ay
sighed
the
sailor
looking
down
on
his
manly
chest
he
s
gone
too
ate
by
sharks
after
ay
ay
he
let
go
of
the
skin
so
that
the
profile
resumed
the
normal
expression
of
before
bit
of
work
one
longshoreman
said
what
s
the
number
for
loafer
number
two
queried
alive
a
third
asked
the
sailor
ay
sighed
again
the
latter
personage
more
cheerily
this
time
with
some
sort
of
a
half
smile
for
a
brief
duration
only
in
the
direction
of
the
questioner
about
the
number
ate
a
greek
he
was
and
then
he
added
with
rather
gallowsbird
humour
considering
his
alleged
end
bad
as
old
antonio
for
he
left
me
on
my
ownio
the
face
of
a
streetwalker
glazed
and
haggard
under
a
black
straw
hat
peered
askew
round
the
door
of
the
shelter
palpably
reconnoitring
on
her
own
with
the
object
of
bringing
more
grist
to
her
mill
mr
bloom
scarcely
knowing
which
way
to
look
turned
away
on
the
moment
flusterfied
but
outwardly
calm
and
picking
up
from
the
table
the
pink
sheet
of
the
abbey
street
organ
which
the
jarvey
if
such
he
was
had
laid
aside
he
picked
it
up
and
looked
at
the
pink
of
the
paper
though
why
pink
his
reason
for
so
doing
was
he
recognised
on
the
moment
round
the
door
the
same
face
he
had
caught
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
that
afternoon
on
ormond
quay
the
partially
idiotic
female
namely
of
the
lane
who
knew
the
lady
in
the
brown
costume
does
be
with
you
mrs
b
and
begged
the
chance
of
his
washing
also
why
washing
which
seemed
rather
vague
than
not
your
washing
still
candour
compelled
him
to
admit
he
had
washed
his
wife
s
undergarments
when
soiled
in
holles
street
and
women
would
and
did
too
a
man
s
similar
garments
initialled
with
bewley
and
draper
s
marking
ink
hers
were
that
is
if
they
really
loved
him
that
is
to
say
love
me
love
my
dirty
shirt
still
just
then
being
on
tenterhooks
he
desired
the
female
s
room
more
than
her
company
so
it
came
as
a
genuine
relief
when
the
keeper
made
her
a
rude
sign
to
take
herself
off
round
the
side
of
the
evening
telegraph
he
just
caught
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
her
face
round
the
side
of
the
door
with
a
kind
of
demented
glassy
grin
showing
that
she
was
not
exactly
all
there
viewing
with
evident
amusement
the
group
of
gazers
round
skipper
murphy
s
nautical
chest
and
then
there
was
no
more
of
her
gunboat
the
keeper
said
beats
me
mr
bloom
confided
to
stephen
medically
i
am
speaking
how
a
wretched
creature
like
that
from
the
lock
hospital
reeking
with
disease
can
be
barefaced
enough
to
solicit
or
how
any
man
in
his
sober
senses
if
he
values
his
health
in
the
least
unfortunate
creature
of
course
i
suppose
some
man
is
ultimately
responsible
for
her
condition
still
no
matter
what
the
cause
is
from
stephen
had
not
noticed
her
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
merely
remarking
this
country
people
sell
much
more
than
she
ever
had
and
do
a
roaring
trade
fear
not
them
that
sell
the
body
but
have
not
power
to
buy
the
soul
she
is
a
bad
merchant
she
buys
dear
and
sells
cheap
the
elder
man
though
not
by
any
manner
of
means
an
old
maid
or
a
prude
said
it
was
nothing
short
of
a
crying
scandal
that
ought
to
be
put
a
stop
to
instanter
to
say
that
women
of
that
stamp
quite
apart
from
any
oldmaidish
squeamishness
on
the
subject
a
necessary
evil
were
not
licensed
and
medically
inspected
by
the
proper
authorities
a
thing
he
could
truthfully
state
he
as
a
paterfamilias
was
a
stalwart
advocate
of
from
the
very
first
start
whoever
embarked
on
a
policy
of
the
sort
he
said
and
ventilated
the
matter
thoroughly
would
confer
a
lasting
boon
on
everybody
concerned
as
a
good
catholic
he
observed
talking
of
body
and
soul
believe
in
the
soul
or
do
you
mean
the
intelligence
the
brainpower
as
such
as
distinct
from
any
outside
object
the
table
let
us
say
that
cup
i
believe
in
that
myself
because
it
has
been
explained
by
competent
men
as
the
convolutions
of
the
grey
matter
otherwise
we
would
never
have
such
inventions
as
x
rays
for
instance
do
you
thus
cornered
stephen
had
to
make
a
superhuman
effort
of
memory
to
try
and
concentrate
and
remember
before
he
could
say
tell
me
on
the
best
authority
it
is
a
simple
substance
and
therefore
incorruptible
it
would
be
immortal
i
understand
but
for
the
possibility
of
its
annihilation
by
its
first
cause
who
from
all
i
can
hear
is
quite
capable
of
adding
that
to
the
number
of
his
other
practical
jokes
corruptio
per
se
and
corruptio
per
accidens
both
being
excluded
by
court
etiquette
mr
bloom
thoroughly
acquiesced
in
the
general
gist
of
this
though
the
mystical
finesse
involved
was
a
bit
out
of
his
sublunary
depth
still
he
felt
bound
to
enter
a
demurrer
on
the
head
of
simple
promptly
rejoining
i
shouldn
t
think
that
is
the
proper
word
of
course
i
grant
you
to
concede
a
point
you
do
knock
across
a
simple
soul
once
in
a
blue
moon
but
what
i
am
anxious
to
arrive
at
is
it
is
one
thing
for
instance
to
invent
those
rays
röntgen
did
or
the
telescope
like
edison
though
i
believe
it
was
before
his
time
galileo
was
the
man
i
mean
and
the
same
applies
to
the
laws
for
example
of
a
farreaching
natural
phenomenon
such
as
electricity
but
it
s
a
horse
of
quite
another
colour
to
say
you
believe
in
the
existence
of
a
supernatural
god
that
stephen
expostulated
has
been
proved
conclusively
by
several
of
the
bestknown
passages
in
holy
writ
apart
from
circumstantial
evidence
on
this
knotty
point
however
the
views
of
the
pair
poles
apart
as
they
were
both
in
schooling
and
everything
else
with
the
marked
difference
in
their
respective
ages
clashed
been
the
more
experienced
of
the
two
objected
sticking
to
his
original
point
with
a
smile
of
unbelief
i
m
not
so
sure
about
that
that
s
a
matter
for
everyman
s
opinion
and
without
dragging
in
the
sectarian
side
of
the
business
i
beg
to
differ
with
you
in
toto
there
my
belief
is
to
tell
you
the
candid
truth
that
those
bits
were
genuine
forgeries
all
of
them
put
in
by
monks
most
probably
or
it
s
the
big
question
of
our
national
poet
over
again
who
precisely
wrote
them
like
hamlet
and
bacon
as
you
who
know
your
shakespeare
infinitely
better
than
i
of
course
i
needn
t
tell
you
can
t
you
drink
that
coffee
by
the
way
let
me
stir
it
and
take
a
piece
of
that
bun
it
s
like
one
of
our
skipper
s
bricks
disguised
still
can
give
what
he
hasn
t
got
try
a
bit
t
stephen
contrived
to
get
out
his
mental
organs
for
the
moment
refusing
to
dictate
further
faultfinding
being
a
proverbially
bad
hat
mr
bloom
thought
well
to
stir
or
try
to
the
clotted
sugar
from
the
bottom
and
reflected
with
something
approaching
acrimony
on
the
coffee
palace
and
its
temperance
and
lucrative
work
to
be
sure
it
was
a
legitimate
object
and
beyond
yea
or
nay
did
a
world
of
good
shelters
such
as
the
present
one
they
were
in
run
on
teetotal
lines
for
vagrants
at
night
concerts
dramatic
evenings
and
useful
lectures
admittance
free
by
qualified
men
for
the
lower
orders
on
the
other
hand
he
had
a
distinct
and
painful
recollection
they
paid
his
wife
madam
marion
tweedy
who
had
been
prominently
associated
with
it
at
one
time
a
very
modest
remuneration
indeed
for
her
pianoplaying
the
idea
he
was
strongly
inclined
to
believe
was
to
do
good
and
net
a
profit
there
being
no
competition
to
speak
of
sulphate
of
copper
poison
or
something
in
some
dried
peas
he
remembered
reading
of
in
a
cheap
eatinghouse
somewhere
but
he
couldn
t
remember
when
it
was
or
where
anyhow
inspection
medical
inspection
of
all
eatables
seemed
to
him
more
than
ever
necessary
which
possibly
accounted
for
the
vogue
of
dr
tibble
s
on
account
of
the
medical
analysis
involved
a
shot
at
it
now
he
ventured
to
say
of
the
coffee
after
being
stirred
thus
prevailed
on
to
at
any
rate
taste
it
stephen
lifted
the
heavy
mug
from
the
brown
puddle
it
clopped
out
of
when
taken
up
by
the
handle
and
took
a
sip
of
the
offending
beverage
it
s
solid
food
his
good
genius
urged
i
m
a
stickler
for
solid
food
his
one
and
only
reason
being
not
gormandising
in
the
least
but
regular
meals
as
the
sine
qua
non
for
any
kind
of
proper
work
mental
or
manual
you
ought
to
eat
more
solid
food
you
would
feel
a
different
man
i
can
eat
stephen
said
but
o
oblige
me
by
taking
away
that
knife
i
can
t
look
at
the
point
of
it
it
reminds
me
of
roman
history
mr
bloom
promptly
did
as
suggested
and
removed
the
incriminated
article
a
blunt
hornhandled
ordinary
knife
with
nothing
particularly
roman
or
antique
about
it
to
the
lay
eye
observing
that
the
point
was
the
least
conspicuous
point
about
it
mutual
friend
s
stories
are
like
himself
mr
bloom
apropos
of
knives
remarked
to
his
confidante
sotto
voce
do
you
think
they
are
genuine
he
could
spin
those
yarns
for
hours
on
end
all
night
long
and
lie
like
old
boots
look
at
him
yet
still
though
his
eyes
were
thick
with
sleep
and
sea
air
life
was
full
of
a
host
of
things
and
coincidences
of
a
terrible
nature
and
it
was
quite
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
it
was
not
an
entire
fabrication
though
at
first
blush
there
was
not
much
inherent
probability
in
all
the
spoof
he
got
off
his
chest
being
strictly
accurate
gospel
he
had
been
meantime
taking
stock
of
the
individual
in
front
of
him
and
sherlockholmesing
him
up
ever
since
he
clapped
eyes
on
him
though
a
wellpreserved
man
of
no
little
stamina
if
a
trifle
prone
to
baldness
there
was
something
spurious
in
the
cut
of
his
jib
that
suggested
a
jail
delivery
and
it
required
no
violent
stretch
of
imagination
to
associate
such
a
weirdlooking
specimen
with
the
oakum
and
treadmill
fraternity
he
might
even
have
done
for
his
man
supposing
it
was
his
own
case
he
told
as
people
often
did
about
others
namely
that
he
killed
him
himself
and
had
served
his
four
or
five
goodlooking
years
in
durance
vile
to
say
nothing
of
the
antonio
personage
no
relation
to
the
dramatic
personage
of
identical
name
who
sprang
from
the
pen
of
our
national
poet
who
expiated
his
crimes
in
the
melodramatic
manner
above
described
on
the
other
hand
he
might
be
only
bluffing
a
pardonable
weakness
because
meeting
unmistakable
mugs
dublin
residents
like
those
jarvies
waiting
news
from
abroad
would
tempt
any
ancient
mariner
who
sailed
the
ocean
seas
to
draw
the
long
bow
about
the
schooner
hesperus
and
etcetera
and
when
all
was
said
and
done
the
lies
a
fellow
told
about
himself
couldn
t
probably
hold
a
proverbial
candle
to
the
wholesale
whoppers
other
fellows
coined
about
him
you
i
m
not
saying
that
it
s
all
a
pure
invention
he
resumed
analogous
scenes
are
occasionally
if
not
often
met
with
giants
though
that
is
rather
a
far
cry
you
see
once
in
a
way
marcella
the
midget
queen
in
those
waxworks
in
henry
street
i
myself
saw
some
aztecs
as
they
are
called
sitting
bowlegged
they
couldn
t
straighten
their
legs
if
you
paid
them
because
the
muscles
here
you
see
he
proceeded
indicating
on
his
companion
the
brief
outline
of
the
sinews
or
whatever
you
like
to
call
them
behind
the
right
knee
were
utterly
powerless
from
sitting
that
way
so
long
cramped
up
being
adored
as
gods
there
s
an
example
again
of
simple
souls
however
reverting
to
friend
sinbad
and
his
horrifying
adventures
who
reminded
him
a
bit
of
ludwig
alias
ledwidge
when
he
occupied
the
boards
of
the
gaiety
when
michael
gunn
was
identified
with
the
management
in
the
flying
dutchman
a
stupendous
success
and
his
host
of
admirers
came
in
large
numbers
everyone
simply
flocking
to
hear
him
though
ships
of
any
sort
phantom
or
the
reverse
on
the
stage
usually
fell
a
bit
flat
as
also
did
trains
there
was
nothing
intrinsically
incompatible
about
it
he
conceded
on
the
contrary
that
stab
in
the
back
touch
was
quite
in
keeping
with
those
italianos
though
candidly
he
was
none
the
less
free
to
admit
those
icecreamers
and
friers
in
the
fish
way
not
to
mention
the
chip
potato
variety
and
so
forth
over
in
little
italy
there
near
the
coombe
were
sober
thrifty
hardworking
fellows
except
perhaps
a
bit
too
given
to
pothunting
the
harmless
necessary
animal
of
the
feline
persuasion
of
others
at
night
so
as
to
have
a
good
old
succulent
tuckin
with
garlic
de
rigueur
off
him
or
her
next
day
on
the
quiet
and
he
added
on
the
cheap
for
instance
he
continued
passionate
temperaments
like
that
impetuous
as
old
nick
are
given
to
taking
the
law
into
their
own
hands
and
give
you
your
quietus
doublequick
with
those
poignards
they
carry
in
the
abdomen
it
comes
from
the
great
heat
climate
generally
my
wife
is
so
to
speak
spanish
half
that
is
point
of
fact
she
could
actually
claim
spanish
nationality
if
she
wanted
having
been
born
in
technically
spain
gibraltar
she
has
the
spanish
type
quite
dark
regular
brunette
black
i
for
one
certainly
believe
climate
accounts
for
character
that
s
why
i
asked
you
if
you
wrote
your
poetry
in
italian
temperaments
at

door
stephen

very
passionate
about

mr

dittoed
stephen
said
staring
and
rambling
on
to
himself
or
some
unknown
listener
somewhere
we
have
the
impetuosity
of
dante
and
the
isosceles
triangle
miss
portinari
he
fell
in
love
with
and
leonardo
and
san

mastino
s
in
the
blood
mr
bloom
acceded
at
once
all
are
washed
in
the
blood
of
the
sun
coincidence
i
just
happened
to
be
in
the
kildare
street
museum
today
shortly
prior
to
our
meeting
if
i
can
so
call
it
and
i
was
just
looking
at
those
antique
statues
there
the
splendid
proportions
of
hips
bosom
you
simply
don
t
knock
against
those
kind
of
women
here
an
exception
here
and
there
handsome
yes
pretty
in
a
way
you
find
but
what
i
m
talking
about
is
the
female
form
besides
they
have
so
little
taste
in
dress
most
of
them
which
greatly
enhances
a
woman
s
natural
beauty
no
matter
what
you
say
rumpled
stockings
it
may
be
possibly
is
a
foible
of
mine
but
still
it
s
a
thing
i
simply
hate
to
see
interest
however
was
starting
to
flag
somewhat
all
round
and
then
the
others
got
on
to
talking
about
accidents
at
sea
ships
lost
in
a
fog
collisions
with
icebergs
all
that
sort
of
thing
shipahoy
of
course
had
his
own
say
to
say
he
had
doubled
the
cape
a
few
odd
times
and
weathered
a
monsoon
a
kind
of
wind
in
the
china
seas
and
through
all
those
perils
of
the
deep
there
was
one
thing
he
declared
stood
to
him
or
words
to
that
effect
a
pious
medal
he
had
that
saved
him
so
then
after

for
the
irish
times
breakers
running
over
her
and
crowds
and
crowds
on
the
shore
in
commotion
petrified
with
horror
then
someone
said
something
about
the
case
of
the
lady
cairns
of
swansea
run
into
by
the
mona
which
was
on
an
opposite
tack
in
rather
muggyish
weather
and
lost
with
all
hands
on
deck
no
aid
was
given
her
master
the
mona
s
said
he
was
afraid
his
collision
bulkhead
would
give
way
she
had
no
water
it
appears
in
her
hold
at
this
stage
an
incident
happened
it
having
become
necessary
for
him
to
unfurl
a
reef
the
sailor
vacated
his
seat
me
cross
your
bows
mate
he
said
to
his
neighbour
who
was
just
gently
dropping
off
into
a
peaceful
doze
he
made
tracks
heavily
slowly
with
a
dumpy
sort
of
a
gait
to
the
door
stepped
heavily
down
the
one
step
there
was
out
of
the
shelter
and
bore
due
left
while
he
was
in
the
act
of
getting
his
bearings
mr
bloom
who
noticed
when
he
stood
up
that
he
had
two
flasks
of
presumably
ship
s
rum
sticking
one
out
of
each
pocket
for
the
private
consumption
of
his
burning
interior
saw
him
produce
a
bottle
and
uncork
it
or
unscrew
and
applying
its
nozzle
to
his
lips
take
a
good
old
delectable
swig
out
of
it
with
a
gurgling
noise
the
irrepressible
bloom
who
also
had
a
shrewd
suspicion
that
the
old
stager
went
out
on
a
manœuvre
after
the
counterattraction
in
the
shape
of
a
female
who
however
had
disappeared
to
all
intents
and
purposes
could
by
straining
just
perceive
him
when
duly
refreshed
by
his
rum
puncheon
exploit
gaping
up
at
the
piers
and
girders
of
the
loop
line
rather
out
of
his
depth
as
of
course
it
was
all
radically
altered
since
his
last
visit
and
greatly
improved
some
person
or
persons
invisible
directed
him
to
the
male
urinal
erected
by
the
cleansing
committee
all
over
the
place
for
the
purpose
but
after
a
brief
space
of
time
during
which
silence
reigned
supreme
the
sailor
evidently
giving
it
a
wide
berth
eased
himself
closer
at
hand
the
noise
of
his
bilgewater
some
little
time
subsequently
splashing
on
the
ground
where
it
apparently
awoke
a
horse
of
the
cabrank
a
hoof
scooped
anyway
for
new
foothold
after
sleep
and
harness
jingled
slightly
disturbed
in
his
sentrybox
by
the
brazier
of
live
coke
the
watcher
of
the
corporation
stones
who
though
now
broken
down
and
fast
breaking
up
was
none
other
in
stern
reality
than
the
gumley
aforesaid
now
practically
on
the
parish
rates
given
the
temporary
job
by
pat
tobin
in
all
human
probability
from
dictates
of
humanity
knowing
him
before
shifted
about
and
shuffled
in
his
box
before
composing
his
limbs
again
in
to
the
arms
of
morpheus
a
truly
amazing
piece
of
hard
lines
in
its
most
virulent
form
on
a
fellow
most
respectably
connected
and
familiarised
with
decent
home
comforts
all
his
life
who
came
in
for
a
cool
a
year
at
one
time
which
of
course
the
doublebarrelled
ass
proceeded
to
make
general
ducks
and
drakes
of
and
there
he
was
at
the
end
of
his
tether
after
having
often
painted
the
town
tolerably
pink
without
a
beggarly
stiver
he
drank
needless
to
be
told
and
it
pointed
only
once
more
a
moral
when
he
might
quite
easily
be
in
a
large
way
of
business
big
if
had
contrived
to
cure
himself
of
his
particular
partiality
all
meantime
were
loudly
lamenting
the
falling
off
in
irish
shipping
coastwise
and
foreign
as
well
which
was
all
part
and
parcel
of
the
same
thing
a
palgrave
murphy
boat
was
put
off
the
ways
at
alexandra
basin
the
only
launch
that
year
right
enough
the
harbours
were
there
only
no
ships
ever
called
there
were
wrecks
and
wreckers
the
keeper
said
who
was
evidently
au
fait
what
he
wanted
to
ascertain
was
why
that
ship
ran
bang
against
the
only
rock
in
galway
bay
when
the
galway
harbour
scheme
was
mooted
by
a
mr
worthington
or
some
name
like
that
eh
ask
the
then
captain
he
advised
them
how
much
palmoil
the
british
government
gave
him
for
that
day

work
captain
john

he
queried
of
the
sailor
now
returning
after
his
private
potation
and
the
rest
of
his
exertions
that
worthy
picking
up
the
scent
of
the
fagend
of
the
song
or
words
growled
in
wouldbe
music
but
with
great
vim
some
kind
of
chanty
or
other
in
seconds
or
thirds
mr
bloom
s
sharp
ears
heard
him
then
expectorate
the
plug
probably
which
it
was
so
that
he
must
have
lodged
it
for
the
time
being
in
his
fist
while
he
did
the
drinking
and
making
water
jobs
and
found
it
a
bit
sour
after
the
liquid
fire
in
question
anyhow
in
he
rolled
after
his
successful
introducing
an
atmosphere
of
drink
into
the
soirée
boisterously
trolling
like
a
veritable
son
of
a
seacook

johnny

o
after
which
effusion
the
redoubtable
specimen
duly
arrived
on
the
scene
and
regaining
his
seat
he
sank
rather
than
sat
heavily
on
the
form
provided
assuming
he
was
he
evidently
with
an
axe
to
grind
was
airing
his
grievances
in
a
philippic
anent
the
natural
resources
of
ireland
or
something
of
that
sort
which
he
described
in
his
lengthy
dissertation
as
the
richest
country
bar
none
on
the
face
of
god
s
earth
far
and
away
superior
to
england
with
coal
in
large
quantities
six
million
pounds
worth
of
pork
exported
every
year
ten
millions
between
butter
and
eggs
and
all
the
riches
drained
out
of
it
by
england
levying
taxes
on
the
poor
people
that
paid
through
the
nose
always
and
gobbling
up
the
best
meat
in
the
market
and
a
lot
more
surplus
steam
in
the
same
vein
their
conversation
accordingly
became
general
and
all
agreed
that
that
was
a
fact
you
could
grow
any
mortal
thing
in
irish
soil
he
stated
and
there
was
that
colonel
everard
down
there
in
navan
growing
tobacco
where
would
you
find
anywhere
the
like
of
irish
bacon
but
a
day
of
reckoning
he
stated
crescendo
with
no
uncertain
voice
thoroughly
monopolising
all
the
conversation
was
in
store
for
mighty
england
despite
her
power
of
pelf
on
account
of
her
crimes
there
would
be
a
fall
and
the
greatest
fall
in
history
the
germans
and
the
japs
were
going
to
have
their
little
lookin
he
affirmed
the
boers
were
the
beginning
of
the
end
brummagem
england
was
toppling
already
and
her
downfall
would
be
ireland
her
achilles
heel
which
he
explained
to
them
about
the
vulnerable
point
of
achilles
the
greek
hero
a
point
his
auditors
at
once
seized
as
he
completely
gripped
their
attention
by
showing
the
tendon
referred
to
on
his
boot
his
advice
to
every
irishman
was
stay
in
the
land
of
your
birth
and
work
for
ireland
and
live
for
ireland
ireland
parnell
said
could
not
spare
a
single
one
of
her
sons
silence
all
round
marked
the
termination
of
his
finale
the
impervious
navigator
heard
these
lurid
tidings
undismayed
a
bit
of
doing
boss
retaliated
that
rough
diamond
palpably
a
bit
peeved
in
response
to
the
foregoing
truism
to
which
cold
douche
referring
to
downfall
and
so
on
the
keeper
concurred
but
nevertheless
held
to
his
main
view
s
the
best
troops
in
the
army
the
grizzled
old
veteran
irately
interrogated
and
the
best
jumpers
and
racers
and
the
best
admirals
and
generals
we
ve
got

s
the
backbone
of
our
empire
you
know
jem
mullins
while
allowing
him
his
individual
opinions
as
everyman
the
keeper
added
he
cared
nothing
for
any
empire
ours
or
his
and
considered
no
irishman
worthy
of
his
salt
that
served
it
then
they
began
to
have
a
few
irascible
words
when
it
waxed
hotter
both
needless
to
say
appealing
to
the
listeners
who
followed
the
passage
of
arms
with
interest
so
long
as
they
didn
t
indulge
in
recriminations
and
come
to
blows
from
inside
information
extending
over
a
series
of
years
mr
bloom
was
rather
inclined
to
poohpooh
the
suggestion
as
egregious
balderdash
for
pending
that
consummation
devoutly
to
be
or
not
to
be
wished
for
he
was
fully
cognisant
of
the
fact
that
their
neighbours
across
the
channel
unless
they
were
much
bigger
fools
than
he
took
them
for
rather
concealed
their
strength
than
the
opposite
it
was
quite
on
a
par
with
the
quixotic
idea
in
certain
quarters
that
in
a
hundred
million
years
the
coal
seam
of
the
sister
island
would
be
played
out
and
if
as
time
went
on
that
turned
out
to
be
how
the
cat
jumped
all
he
could
personally
say
on
the
matter
was
that
as
a
host
of
contingencies
equally
relevant
to
the
issue
might
occur
ere
then
it
was
highly
advisable
in
the
interim
to
try
to
make
the
most
of
both
countries
even
though
poles
apart
another
little
interesting
point
the
amours
of
whores
and
chummies
to
put
it
in
common
parlance
reminded
him
irish
soldiers
had
as
often
fought
for
england
as
against
her
more
so
in
fact
and
now
why
so
the
scene
between
the
pair
of
them
the
licensee
of
the
place
rumoured
to
be
or
have
been
fitzharris
the
famous
invincible
and
the
other
obviously
bogus
reminded
him
forcibly
as
being
on
all
fours
with
the
confidence
trick
supposing
that
is
it
was
prearranged
as
the
lookeron
a
student
of
the
human
soul
if
anything
the
others
seeing
least
of
the
game
and
as
for
the
lessee
or
keeper
who
probably
wasn
t
the
other
person
at
all
he
b
couldn
t
help
feeling
and
most
properly
it
was
better
to
give
people
like
that
the
goby
unless
you
were
a
blithering
idiot
altogether
and
refuse
to
have
anything
to
do
with
them
as
a
golden
rule
in
private
life
and
their
felonsetting
there
always
being
the
offchance
of
a
dannyman
coming
forward
and
turning
queen
s
evidence
or
king
s
now
like
denis
or
peter
carey
an
idea
he
utterly
repudiated
quite
apart
from
that
he
disliked
those
careers
of
wrongdoing
and
crime
on
principle
yet
though
such
criminal
propensities
had
never
been
an
inmate
of
his
bosom
in
any
shape
or
form
he
certainly
did
feel
and
no
denying
it
while
inwardly
remaining
what
he
was
a
certain
kind
of
admiration
for
a
man
who
had
actually
brandished
a
knife
cold
steel
with
the
courage
of
his
political
convictions
though
personally
he
would
never
be
a
party
to
any
such
thing
off
the
same
bat
as
those
love
vendettas
of
the
south
have
her
or
swing
for
her
when
the
husband
frequently
after
some
words
passed
between
the
two
concerning
her
relations
with
the
other
lucky
mortal
he
having
had
the
pair
watched
inflicted
fatal
injuries
on
his
adored
one
as
a
result
of
an
alternative
postnuptial
liaison
by
plunging
his
knife
into
her
until
it
just
struck
him
that
fitz
nicknamed
merely
drove
the
car
for
the
actual
perpetrators
of
the
outrage
and
so
was
not
if
he
was
reliably
informed
actually
party
to
the
ambush
which
in
point
of
fact
was
the
plea
some
legal
luminary
saved
his
skin
on
in
any
case
that
was
very
ancient
history
by
now
and
as
for
our
friend
the
pseudo
he
had
transparently
outlived
his
welcome
he
ought
to
have
either
died
naturally
or
on
the
scaffold
high
like
actresses
always
farewell
positively
last
performance
then
come
up
smiling
again
generous
to
a
fault
of
course
temperamental
no
economising
or
any
idea
of
the
sort
always
snapping
at
the
bone
for
the
shadow
so
similarly
he
had
a
very
shrewd
suspicion
that
mr
johnny
lever
got
rid
of
some
in
the
course
of
his
perambulations
round
the
docks
in
the
congenial
atmosphere
of
the
old
ireland
tavern
come
back
to
erin
and
so
on
then
as
for
the
other
he
had
heard
not
so
long
before
the
same
identical
lingo
as
he
told
stephen
how
he
simply
but
effectually
silenced
the
offender
took
umbrage
at
something
or
other
that
muchinjured
but
on
the
whole
eventempered
person
declared
i
let
slip
he
called
me
a
jew
and
in
a
heated
fashion
offensively
so
i
without
deviating
from
plain
facts
in
the
least
told
him
his
god
i
mean
christ
was
a
jew
too
and
all
his
family
like
me
though
in
reality
i
m
not
that
was
one
for
him
a
soft
answer
turns
away
wrath
he
hadn
t
a
word
to
say
for
himself
as
everyone
saw
am
i
not
right
he
turned
a
long
you
are
wrong
gaze
on
stephen
of
timorous
dark
pride
at
the
soft
impeachment
with
a
glance
also
of
entreaty
for
he
seemed
to
glean
in
a
kind
of
a
way
that
it
wasn
t
all
exactly
quibus
stephen
mumbled
in
a
noncommittal
accent
their
two
or
four
eyes
conversing
christus
or
bloom
his
name
is
or
after
all
any
other
secundum
carnem
course
mr
proceeded
to
stipulate
you
must
look
at
both
sides
of
the
question
it
is
hard
to
lay
down
any
hard
and
fast
rules
as
to
right
and
wrong
but
room
for
improvement
all
round
there
certainly
is
though
every
country
they
say
our
own
distressful
included
has
the
government
it
deserves
but
with
a
little
goodwill
all
round
it
s
all
very
fine
to
boast
of
mutual
superiority
but
what
about
mutual
equality
i
resent
violence
and
intolerance
in
any
shape
or
form
it
never
reaches
anything
or
stops
anything
a
revolution
must
come
on
the
due
instalments
plan
it
s
a
patent
absurdity
on
the
face
of
it
to
hate
people
because
they
live
round
the
corner
and
speak
another
vernacular
in
the
next
house
so
to
speak
bloody
bridge
battle
and
seven
minutes
war
stephen
assented
between
skinner
s
alley
and
ormond
market
yes
mr
bloom
thoroughly
agreed
entirely
endorsing
the
remark
that
was
overwhelmingly
right
and
the
whole
world
was
full
of
that
sort
of
thing
just
took
the
words
out
of
my
mouth
he
said
a
hocuspocus
of
conflicting
evidence
that
candidly
you
couldn
t
remotely
all
those
wretched
quarrels
in
his
humble
opinion
stirring
up
bad
blood
from
some
bump
of
combativeness
or
gland
of
some
kind
erroneously
supposed
to
be
about
a
punctilio
of
honour
and
a
flag
were
very
largely
a
question
of
the
money
question
which
was
at
the
back
of
everything
greed
and
jealousy
people
never
knowing
when
to
stop
accuse
remarked
he
audibly
he
turned
away
from
the
others
who
and
spoke
nearer
to
so
as
the
in
case
he
softly
imparted
in
an
aside
in
stephen
s
ear
are
accused
of
ruining
not
a
vestige
of
truth
in
it
i
can
safely
say
history
would
you
be
surprised
to
learn
proves
up
to
the
hilt

to

as

where
you
can
live
well
the
sense
is
if
you
work
over
his
untastable
apology
for
a
cup
of
coffee
listening
to
this
synopsis
of
things
in
general
stephen
stared
at
nothing
in
particular
he
could
hear
of
course
all
kinds
of
words
changing
colour
like
those
crabs
about
ringsend
in
the
morning
burrowing
quickly
into
all
colours
of
different
sorts
of
the
same
sand
where
they
had
a
home
somewhere
beneath
or
seemed
to
then
he
looked
up
and
saw
the
eyes
that
said
or
didn
t
say
the
words
the
voice
he
heard
said
if
you
work
me
out
he
managed
to
remark
meaning
work
the
eyes
were
surprised
at
this
observation
because
as
he
the
person
who
owned
them
pro
tem
observed
or
rather
his
voice
speaking
did
all
must
work
have
to
together
mean
of
course
the
other
hastened
to
affirm
work
in
the
widest
possible
sense
also
literary
labour
not
merely
for
the
kudos
of
the
thing
writing
for
the
newspapers
which
is
the
readiest
channel
nowadays
that
s
work
too
important
work
after
all
from
the
little
i
know
of
you
after
all
the
money
expended
on
your
education
you
are
entitled
to
recoup
yourself
and
command
your
price
you
have
every
bit
as
much
right
to
live
by
your
pen
in
pursuit
of
your
philosophy
as
the
peasant
has
what
you
both
belong
to
ireland
the
brain
and
the
brawn
each
is
equally
important
suspect
stephen
retorted
with
a
sort
of
a
half
laugh
that
i
may
be
important
because
i
belong
to
the
faubourg
saint
patrice
called
ireland
for
short
would
go
a
step
farther
mr

insinuated
i

stephen
interrupted
that
ireland
must
be
important
because
it
belongs
to
me
belongs
queried
mr
bloom
bending
fancying
he
was
perhaps
under
some
misapprehension
excuse
me
unfortunately
i
didn
t
catch
the
latter
portion
what
was
it
you
stephen
patently
crosstempered
repeated
and
shoved
aside
his
mug
of
coffee
or
whatever
you
like
to
call
it
none
too
politely
adding
can
t
change
the
country
let
us
change
the
subject
at
this
pertinent
suggestion
mr
bloom
to
change
the
subject
looked
down
but
in
a
quandary
as
he
couldn
t
tell
exactly
what
construction
to
put
on
belongs
to
which
sounded
rather
a
far
cry
the
rebuke
of
some
kind
was
clearer
than
the
other
part
needless
to
say
the
fumes
of
his
recent
orgy
spoke
then
with
some
asperity
in
a
curious
bitter
way
foreign
to
his
sober
state
probably
the
homelife
to
which
mr
b
attached
the
utmost
importance
had
not
been
all
that
was
needful
or
he
hadn
t
been
familiarised
with
the
right
sort
of
people
with
a
touch
of
fear
for
the
young
man
beside
him
whom
he
furtively
scrutinised
with
an
air
of
some
consternation
remembering
he
had
just
come
back
from
paris
the
eyes
more
especially
reminding
him
forcibly
of
father
and
sister
failing
to
throw
much
light
on
the
subject
however
he
brought
to
mind
instances
of
cultured
fellows
that
promised
so
brilliantly
nipped
in
the
bud
of
premature
decay
and
nobody
to
blame
but
themselves
for
instance
there
was
the
case
of
o
callaghan
for
one
the
halfcrazy
faddist
respectably
connected
though
of
inadequate
means
with
his
mad
vagaries
among
whose
other
gay
doings
when
rotto
and
making
himself
a
nuisance
to
everybody
all
round
he
was
in
the
habit
of
ostentatiously
sporting
in
public
a
suit
of
brown
paper
a
fact
and
then
the
usual
dénouement
after
the
fun
had
gone
on
fast
and
furious
he
got
landed
into
hot
water
and
had
to
be
spirited
away
by
a
few
friends
after
a
strong
hint
to
a

he
felt

even
to
wait
on

profit
by
the
unlookedfor
occasion
though
why
he
could
not

himself
in

to

lately

whether

with
anything
approaching
the

he

they

a
dublin
fusilier
was
in

shelter
one
night
and
said
he
saw
him
in

africa
pride
it
was
killed
him
he
ought
to
have
done
away
with
himself
or
lain
low
for
a
time
after
committee
room
no
until
he
was
his
old
self
again
with
to
point
a
finger
at
him
then
they
would
all
to
a
man
have
gone
down
on
their
marrowbones
to
him
to
come
back
when
he
had
recovered
his
senses
dead
he
wasn
t
simply
absconded
somewhere
the
coffin
they
brought
over
was
full
of
stones
he
changed
his
name
to
de
wet
the
boer
general
he
made
a
mistake
to
fight
the
priests
and
so
forth
and
so
on
all
the
same
bloom
properly
so
dubbed
was
rather
surprised
at
their
memories
for
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
it
was
a
case
of
tarbarrels
and
not
singly
but
in
their
thousands
and
then
complete
oblivion
because
it
was
twenty
odd
years
highly
unlikely
of
course
there
was
even
a
shadow
of
truth
in
the
stones
and
even
supposing
he
thought
a
return
highly
inadvisable
all
things
considered
something
evidently
riled
them
in
his
death
either
he
petered
out
too
tamely
of
acute
pneumonia
just
when
his
various
different
political
arrangements
were
nearing
completion
or
whether
it
transpired
he
owed
his
death
to
his
having
neglected
to
change
his
boots
and
clothes
after
a
wetting
when
a
cold
resulted
and
failing
to
consult
a
specialist
he
being
confined
to
his
room
till
he
eventually
died
of
it
amid
widespread
regret
before
a
fortnight
was
at
an
end
or
quite
possibly
they
were
distressed
to
find
the
job
was
taken
out
of
their
hands
of
course
nobody
being
acquainted
with
his
movements
even
before
there
was
absolutely
no
clue
as
to
his
whereabouts
which
were
decidedly
of
the
alice
where
art
thou
order
even
prior
to
his
starting
to
go
under
several
aliases
such
as
fox
and
stewart
so
the
remark
which
emanated
from
friend
cabby
might
be
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
naturally
then
it
would
prey
on
his
mind
as
a
born
leader
of
men
which
undoubtedly
he
was
and
a
commanding
figure
a
sixfooter
or
at
any
rate
five
feet
ten
or
eleven
in
his
stockinged
feet
whereas
messrs
so
and
so
who
though
they
weren

even
a
patch
on
the
former
man
ruled
the
roost
after
their
redeeming
features
were
very
few
and
far
between

certainly
pointed
a
moral
the
idol
with
feet
of
clay
and
then
seventytwo
of
his
trusty
henchmen
rounding
on
him
with
mutual
mudslinging
and
the
identical

with

you
had
to
come
back
that
haunting
sense
kind
of
drew
you
to
show
the
understudy
in
the
title
rôle
how
to
he
saw
him
once
on
the
auspicious
occasion
when
they
broke
up
the
type
in
the
insuppressible
or
was
it
united
ireland
a
privilege
he
keenly
appreciated
and
in
point
of
fact
handed
him
his
silk
hat
when
it
was
knocked
off
and
he
said
thank
you
excited
as
he
undoubtedly
was
under
his
frigid
exterior
notwithstanding
the
little
misadventure
mentioned
between
the
cup
and
the
lip
what
s
bred
in
the
bone
still
as
regards
return
you
were
a
lucky
dog
if
they
didn
t
set
the
terrier
at
you
directly
you
got
back
then
a
lot
of
shillyshally

followed
tom
for

dick
and
harry
against

then
number
one
you
came
up
against

occasioned

among

as

he
without
the

suspicion
of

merely
gazed
in
the
direction
of
the
door
and
reflected
upon
the
historic
story
which
had
aroused
extraordinary
interest
at
the
time
when
the
facts
to
make
matters
worse
were
made
public
with
the
usual
affectionate
letters
that
passed
between
them
full
of
sweet
nothings
first
it
was
strictly
platonic
till
nature
intervened
and
an
attachment
sprang
up
between
them
till
bit
by
bit
matters
came
to
a
climax
and
the
matter
became
the
talk
of
the
town
till
the
staggering
blow
came
as
a
welcome
intelligence
to
not
a
few
evildisposed
however
who
were
resolved
upon
encompassing
his
downfall
though
the
thing
was
public
property
all
along
though
not
to
anything
like
the
sensational
extent
that
it
subsequently
blossomed
into
since
their
names
were
coupled
though
since
he
was
her
declared
favourite
where
was
the
particular
necessity
to
proclaim
it
to
the
rank
and
file
from
the
housetops
the
fact
namely
that
he
had
shared
her
bedroom
which
came
out
in
the
witnessbox
on
oath
when
a
thrill
went
through
the
packed
court
literally
electrifying
everybody
in
the
shape
of
witnesses
swearing
to
having
witnessed
him
on
such
and
such
a
particular
date
in
the
act
of
scrambling
out
of
an
upstairs
apartment
with
the
assistance
of
a
ladder
in
night
apparel
having
gained
admittance
in
the
same
fashion
a
fact
the
weeklies
addicted
to
the
lubric
a
little
simply
coined
shoals
of
money
out
of
whereas
the
simple
fact
of
the
case
was
it
was
simply
a
case
of
the
husband
not
being
up
to
the
scratch
with
nothing
in
common
between
them
beyond
the
name
and
then
a
real
man
arriving
on
the
scene
strong
to
the
verge
of
weakness
falling
a
victim
to
her
siren
charms
and
forgetting
home
ties
the
usual
sequel
to
bask
in
the
loved
one
s
smiles
the
eternal
question
of
the

though
it
was
no

of
theirs
absolutely
if

regarded

with

carried
away
by
a
wave
of
folly
a
magnificent
specimen
of
manhood
he
was
truly
augmented
obviously
by
gifts
of
a
high
order
as
compared
with
the
other
military
supernumerary

which
she

quickly
perceived
as

he
had
done

in

rural

of
the
country
by
taking
up
the
cudgels
on
their
behalf
in
a
way
that
exceeded
their
most
sanguine
expectations
very
effectually
cooked
his
matrimonial
goose
thereby
heaping
coals
of
fire
on
his
head
much
in

seemed

his

he
intimated
was
the
accomplished
daughter
of

an

age
remarkable
proficiency

a
singer
having
even
made
her
bow
to
the
public
when
her
years
numbered
barely
sweet
sixteen
as
for
the
face
it
was
a
speaking
likeness
in
expression
but
it
did
not
do
justice
to
her
figure
which
came

he
would
much
have

to
follow
jack

good
example
and
leave
the

there
for
a
very
few
minutes
to

for

on
the
plea
he
so
that
the

could

her

being
frankly
a
treat
in
itself
which
the

could
not
at
all
do
justice
to
but
it
was
scarcely
professional
etiquette
so
though
it
was
a
warm
pleasant
sort
of
a
night
now
yet
wonderfully
cool
for
the
season
considering
for
sunshine
after
storm
and
he
did
feel
a
kind
of
need
there
and
then
to
follow
suit
like
a
kind
of
inward
voice
and
satisfy
a
possible
need
by
moving
a
motion
nevertheless
he
sat
tight
just
viewing
the
slightly
soiled
photo
creased
by
opulent
curves
none
the
worse
for
wear
however
and
looked
away
thoughtfully
with
the
intention
of
not
further
increasing
the
other
s
possible
embarrassment
while
gauging
her
symmetry
of
heaving
embonpoint
in
fact
the
slight
soiling
was
only
an
added
charm

into
his
mind
but
merely
as
a
passing
fancy
of
his

recollected

the

of

though
you
wouldn

think

had
it
in
him
yet
you
would
besides
he
said
the
picture
was
handsome
which
say
what
you
like
it
was
though
at
the
moment
she
was
distinctly
stouter
and
why
not
an
awful
lot
of
makebelieve
went
on
about
that
sort
of
thing
involving
a
lifelong
slur
with
the
usual
splash
page
of
gutterpress
about
the
same
old
matrimonial
tangle
alleging
misconduct
with

golfer
or
the
newest

favourite
instead
of
being
honest
and
aboveboard
about
the
whole
business
how
they
were
fated
to
meet
and
an
attachment
sprang
up
between
the
two
so
that
their
names
were
coupled

the
public
eye
was
told
in
court
with
letters
containing
the
habitual
mushy
and
compromising
expressions
leaving
no
loophole
to
show
that
they
openly
cohabited
two
or
three
times

at

on

scurrilous

pens
of
the

at
the
usual
mudslinging
occupation
reflecting
on
the
erstwhile

private
morals
though
palpably
a
radically
altered
man
he
was
still
a
commanding
figure
though
carelessly
garbed
as
usual
with
that
look
of
settled
purpose
which
went
a
long
way
with
the
shillyshallyers
till
they
discovered
to
their
vast
discomfiture
that
their
idol
had
feet
of
clay
after
placing
him
upon
a
pedestal
which
she
however
was
the
first
to
perceive
as
those
were
particularly
hot
times
in
the
general
hullaballoo

a
minor
injury
from
a
nasty
prod
of
some

in

some
place
about
the
pit
of
the
stomach
fortunately
not
of
a
grave
character
his
hat
parnell
s
a
silk
one
was
inadvertently
knocked
off
and
as
a
matter
of
strict
history
bloom
was
the
man
who
picked
it
up
in
the
crush
after
witnessing
the
occurrence
meaning
to
return
it
to
him
and
return
it
to
him
he
did
with
the
utmost
celerity
who
panting
and
hatless
and
whose
thoughts
were
miles
away
from
his
hat
at
the
time

the

a

born
with
a
stake
in

country
he
as
a

of

having
gone
into
it
more
for
the
kudos
of
the

anything
else
what

out
at
once
because
he
turned
round
to
the
donor
and
thanked
him
with
perfect
aplomb
saying
thank
you
sir
though
in
a
very
different
tone
of
voice
from
the
ornament
of
the
legal
profession
whose
headgear
bloom
also
set
to
rights
earlier
in
the
course
of
the
day
history
repeating
itself
with
a
difference
after
the
burial
of
a
mutual
friend
when
they
had
left
him
alone
in
his
glory
after
the
grim
task
of
having
committed
his
remains
to
the
grave
on
the
other
hand
what
incensed
him
more
inwardly
was
the
blatant
jokes
of
the
cabman
and
so
on
who
passed
it
all
off
as
a
jest
laughing
immoderately
pretending
to
understand
everything
the
why
and
the
wherefore
and
in
reality
not
knowing
their
own
minds
it
being
a
case
for
the
two
parties
themselves
unless
it
ensued
that
the
legitimate
husband
happened
to
be
a
party
to
it
owing
to
some
anonymous
letter
from
the
usual
boy
jones
who
happened
to
come
across
them
at
the
crucial
moment
in
a
loving
position
locked
in
one
another
s
arms
drawing
attention
to
their
illicit
proceedings
and
leading
up
to
a
domestic
rumpus
and
the
erring
fair
one
begging
forgiveness
of
her
lord
and
master
upon
her
knees
and
promising
to
sever
the
connection
and
not
receive
his
visits
any
more
if
only
the
aggrieved
husband
would
overlook
the
matter
and
let
bygones
be
bygones
with
tears
in
her
eyes
though
possibly
with
her
tongue
in
her
fair
cheek
at
the
same
time
as
quite
possibly
there
were
several
others
he
personally
being
of
a
sceptical
bias
believed
and
didn
t
make
the
smallest
bones
about
saying
so
either
that
man
or
men
in
the
plural
were
always
hanging
around
on
the
waiting
list
about
a
lady
even
supposing
she
was
the
best
wife
in
the
world
and
they
got
on
fairly
well
together
for
the
sake
of
argument
when
neglecting
her
duties
she
chose
to
be
tired
of
wedded
life
and
was
on
for
a
little
flutter
in
polite
debauchery
to
press
their
attentions
on
her
with
improper
intent
the
upshot
being
that
her
affections
centred
on
another
the
cause
of
many
liaisons
between
still
attractive
married
women
getting
on
for
fair
and
forty
and
younger
men
no
doubt
as
several
famous
cases
of
feminine
infatuation
proved
up
to
the
hilt
it
was
a
thousand
pities
a
young
fellow
blessed
with
an
allowance
of
brains
as
his
neighbour
obviously
was
should
waste
his
valuable
time
with
profligate
women

one
day
take
unto
himself
a

miss

on

scene

in
the
interim
ladies
society
was
a
conditio

he
had
the
gravest
possible
doubts
not
that
he
wanted
in
the
smallest
to
pump
stephen

miss
ferguson
who
was
very
possibly
the
particular
lodestar
who
brought
him
down
to
irishtown

early
in
the

as
to
whether
he
would
find
much
satisfaction
basking
in
the

the
company
of
smirking
misses

the
elder
man
who
was
several
years
the

senior
or
like
his

something
substantial
he
certainly
ought
to
eat

it

an

unadulterated
maternal
nutriment
or

that
the
homely

he

it
was

friday
ah
you

it

after
twelve
day
before
yesterday
stephen
said
improving
on
himself
literally
astounded
at
this
piece
of
intelligence
bloom
reflected
though
they
didn
t
see
eye
to
eye
in
everything
a
certain
analogy
there
somehow
was
as
if
both
their
minds
were
travelling
so
to
speak
in
the
one
train
of
thought
at
his
age
when
dabbling
in
politics
roughly
some
score
of
years
previously
when
he
had
been
a
quasi
aspirant
to
parliamentary
honours
in
the
buckshot
foster
days
he
too
recollected
in
retrospect
which
was
a
source
of
keen
satisfaction
in
itself
he
had
a
sneaking
regard
for
those
same
ultra
ideas
for
instance
when
the
evicted
tenants
question
then
at
its
first
inception
bulked
largely
in
people
s
mind
though
it
goes
without
saying
not
contributing
a
copper
or
pinning
his
faith
absolutely
to
its
dictums
some
of
which
wouldn
t
exactly
hold
water
he
at
the
outset
in
principle
at
all
events
was
in
thorough
sympathy
with
peasant
possession
as
voicing
the
trend
of
modern
opinion
a
partiality
however
which
realising
his
mistake
he
was
subsequently
partially
cured
of
and
even
was
twitted
with
going
a
step
farther
than
michael
davitt
in
the
striking
views
he
at
one
time
inculcated
as
a
backtothelander
which
was
one
reason
he
strongly
resented
the
innuendo
put
upon
him
in
so
barefaced
a
fashion
by
our
friend
at
the
gathering
of
the
clans
in
barney
kiernan
s
so
that
he
though
often
considerably
misunderstood
and
the
least
pugnacious
of
mortals
be
it
repeated
departed
from
his
customary
habit
to
give
him
metaphorically
one
in
the
gizzard
though
so
far
as
politics
themselves
were
concerned
he
was
only
too
conscious
of
the
casualties
invariably
resulting
from
propaganda
and
displays
of
mutual
animosity
and
the
misery
and
suffering
it
entailed
as
a
foregone
conclusion
on
fine
young
fellows
chiefly
destruction
of
the
fittest
in
a
word
anyhow
upon
weighing
up
the
pros
and
cons
getting
on
for
one
as
it
was
it
was
high
time
to
be
retiring
for
the
night
the
crux
was
it
was
a
bit
risky
to
bring
him
home
as
eventualities
might
possibly
ensue
somebody
having
a
temper
of
her
own
sometimes
and
spoil
the
hash
altogether
as
on
the
night
he
misguidedly
brought
home
a
dog
breed
unknown
with
a
lame
paw
not
that
the
cases
were
either
identical
or
the
reverse
though
he
had
hurt
his
hand
too
to
ontario
terrace
as
he
very
distinctly
remembered
having
been
there
so
to
speak
on
the
other
hand
it
was
altogether
far
and
away
too
late
for
the
sandymount
or
sandycove
suggestion
so
that
he
was
in
some
perplexity
as
to
which
of
the
two
alternatives
everything
pointed
to
the
fact
that
it
behoved
him
to
avail
himself
to
the
full
of
the
opportunity
all
things
considered
his
initial
impression
was
he
was
a
shade
standoffish
or
not
over
effusive
but
it
grew
on
him
someway
for
one
thing
he
mightn
t
what
you
call
jump
at
the
idea
if
approached
and
what
mostly
worried
him
was
he
didn
t
know
how
to
lead
up
to
it
or
word
it
exactly
supposing
he
did
entertain
the
proposal
as
it
would
afford
him
very
great
personal
pleasure
if
he
would
allow
him
to
help
to
put
coin
in
his
way
or
some
wardrobe
if
found
suitable
at
all
events
he
wound
up
by
concluding
eschewing
for
the
nonce
hidebound
precedent
a
cup
of
epps
s
cocoa
and
a
shakedown
for
the
night
plus
the
use
of
a
rug
or
two
and
overcoat
doubled
into
a
pillow
at
least
he
would
be
in
safe
hands
and
as
warm
as
a
toast
on
a
trivet
he
failed
to
perceive
any
very
vast
amount
of
harm
in
that
always
with
the
proviso
no
rumpus
of
any
sort
was
kicked
up
a
move
had
to
be
made
because
that
merry
old
soul
the
grasswidower
in
question
who
appeared
to
be
glued
to
the
spot
didn
t
appear
in
any
particular
hurry
to
wend
his
way
home
to
his
dearly
beloved
queenstown
and
it
was
highly
likely
some
sponger
s
bawdyhouse
of
retired
beauties
where
age
was
no
bar
off
sheriff
street
lower
would
be
the
best
clue
to
that
equivocal
character
s
whereabouts
for
a
few
days
to
come
alternately
racking
their
feelings
the
mermaids
with
sixchamber
revolver
anecdotes
verging
on
the
tropical
calculated
to
freeze
the
marrow
of
anybody
s
bones
and
mauling
their
largesized
charms
betweenwhiles
with
rough
and
tumble
gusto
to
the
accompaniment
of
large
potations
of
potheen
and
the
usual
blarney
about
himself

as
to
who
he
in
reality
was
let
x
equal
my
right
name
and
address
as

passim
at
the

time
he
inwardly
chuckled
over
his
gentle
repartee
to
the
blood
and
ouns
champion
about
his
god
being
a
jew
people
could
put
up
with
being
bitten
by
a

but
what
properly
riled
them
was
a
bite
from
a
sheep
the
most
vulnerable
point
too
of
tender
achilles
your
god
was
a

they

our

suggested
after
mature

while
prudently

beckoned
while
prudently
pocketing
the
photo
to
the
keeper
of
the
shanty
who
didn
t
seem
to
that
s
the

assured
stephen

the
world
and
his

from
the
housetops
about
it
and
a
slice
of
luck

opening
was
all
was
wanted
because

more
than
suspected
he
had
his

to
bank
his
hopes
on
which
it
was
quite
on
the

it

with

then
the

in

appeared
to
have

spark
of

left
read
out

completely
regardless

the

was
intensely
occupied
loosening
an
apparently
new
or
secondhand
boot
which
manifestly
pinched
him
as
he
muttered
against
whoever
it
was
sold

all
of
them
who
were
sufficiently
awake
enough
to
be
picked
out
by
their
facial
expressions

to

simply
looking
on
glumly
or
passing
a
trivial
remark
to
cut
a
long
story

the

the
first
to
rise
from
his
seat
so
as
not
to
outstay
their
welcome
having
first
and
foremost
being
as
good
as
his
word
that
he
would
foot
the
bill
for
the
occasion
taken
the
wise
precaution
to
unobtrusively
motion
to
mine
host
as
a
parting
shot
a
scarcely
perceptible
sign
when
the
others
were
not
looking
to
the
effect
that
the
amount
due
was
forthcoming
making
a
grand
total
of
fourpence
the
amount
he
deposited
unobtrusively
in
four
coppers
literally
the
last
of
the
mohicans
he
having
previously
spotted
on
the

pricelist
for
all
who
ran
to

coffee

do
and
honestly

worth
twice
the

once
in
a
way
as
wetherup
used
to
remark
he
counselled
to
close
the
séance
seeing
that
the
ruse
worked
and
the
coast
was
clear
they
left
the
shelter
or
shanty
together
and
the
élite
society
of
oilskin
and
company

nothing
short
of
an
earthquake
would
move

stephen
who
confessed
to
still
feeling
poorly
and
fagged
out
paused
at
the
for
a
moment
the
door
thing
i
never
understood
he
said
to
be
original
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
why
they
put
tables
upside
down
at
night
i
mean
chairs
upside
down
on
the
tables
in
cafés
to
which
impromptu
the
neverfailing
bloom
replied
without
a
moment
s
hesitation
saying
straight
off
sweep
the
floor
in
the
morning
so
saying
he
skipped
around
nimbly
considering
frankly
at
the
same
time
apologetic
to
get
on
his
companion
s
right
a
habit
of
his
by
the
bye
his
right
side
being
in
classical
idiom
his
tender
achilles
the
night
air
was
certainly
now
a
treat
to
breathe
though
stephen
was
a
bit
weak
on
his
pins
will
the
air
do
you
good
bloom
said
meaning
also
the
walk
in
a
moment
the
only
thing
is
to
walk
then
you
ll
feel
a
different
man
come
it
s
not
far
lean
on
me
accordingly
he
passed
his
left
arm
in
stephen
s
right
and
led
him
on
accordingly
stephen
said
uncertainly
because
he
thought
he
felt
a
strange
kind
of
flesh
of
a
different
man
approach
him
sinewless
and
wobbly
and
all
that
anyhow
they
passed
the
sentrybox
with
stones
brazier
etc
where
the
municipal
supernumerary
ex
gumley
was
still
to
all
intents
and
purposes
wrapped
in
the
arms
of
murphy
as
the
adage
has
it
dreaming
of
fresh
fields
and
pastures
new
and
apropos
of
coffin
of
stones
the
analogy
was
not
at
all
bad
as
it
was
in
fact
a
stoning
to
death
on
the
part
of
seventytwo
out
of
eighty
odd
constituencies
that
ratted
at
the
time
of
the
split
and
chiefly
the
belauded
peasant
class
probably
the
selfsame
evicted
tenants
he
had
put
in
their
holdings
so
they
turned
on
to
chatting
about
music
a
form
of
art
for
which
bloom
as
a
pure
amateur
possessed
the
greatest
love
as
they
made
tracks
arm
in
arm
across
beresford
place
wagnerian
music
though
confessedly
grand
in
its
way
was
a
bit
too
heavy
for
bloom
and
hard
to
follow
at
the
first
but
the
music
of
mercadante
s
huguenots
meyerbeer
s
seven
last
words
on
the
cross
and
mozart
s
twelfth
mass
he
simply
revelled
in
the
gloria
in
that
being
to
his
mind
the
acme
of
first
class
music
as
such
literally
knocking
everything
else
into
a
cocked
hat
he
infinitely
preferred
the
sacred
music
of
the
catholic
church
to
anything
the
opposite
shop
could
offer
in
that
line
such
as
those
moody
and
sankey
hymns
or
bid
me
to
live
and
i
will
live
thy
protestant
to
be
he
also
yielded
to
none
in
his
admiration
of
rossini
s
stabat
mater
a
work
simply
abounding
in
immortal
numbers
in
which
his
wife
madam
marion
tweedy
made
a
hit
a
veritable
sensation
he
might
safely
say
greatly
adding
to
her
other
laurels
and
putting
the
others
totally
in
the
shade
in
the
jesuit
fathers
church
in
upper
gardiner
street
the
sacred
edifice
being
thronged
to
the
doors
to
hear
her
with
virtuosos
or
virtuosi
rather
there
was
the
unanimous
opinion
that
there
was
none
to
come
up
to
her
and
suffice
it
to
say
in
a
place
of
worship
for
music
of
a
sacred
character
there
was
a
generally
voiced
desire
for
an
encore
on
the
whole
though
favouring
preferably
light
opera
of
the
don
giovanni
description
and
martha
a
gem
in
its
line
he
had
a
penchant
though
with
only
a
surface
knowledge
for
the
severe
classical
school
such
as
mendelssohn
and
talking
of
that
taking
it
for
granted
he
knew
all
about
the
old
favourites
he
mentioned
par
excellence
lionel
s
air
in
martha
m
appari
which
curiously
enough
he
had
heard
or
overheard
to
be
more
accurate
on
yesterday
a
privilege
he
keenly
appreciated
from
the
lips
of
stephen
s
respected
father
sung
to
perfection
a
study
of
the
number
in
fact
which
made
all
the
others
take
a
back
seat
stephen
in
reply
to
a
politely
put
query
said
he
didn
t
sing
it
but
launched
out
into
praises
of
shakespeare
s
songs
at
least
of
in
or
about
that
period
the
lutenist
dowland
who
lived
in

on

perfectly
certain
whether
he
had
caught
aright
the
allusion
to
sixtyfive
guineas
and
john
bull
he
inquired
if
it
was
john
bull
the
political
celebrity
of
that
ilk
as
it
struck
him
the
two
identical
names
as
a
striking
coincidence
by
the
chains
the
horse
slowly
swerved
to
turn
which
perceiving
bloom
who
was
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
as
usual
plucked
the
other
s
sleeve
gently
jocosely
remarking
lives
are
in
peril
tonight
beware
of
the
steamroller
they
thereupon
stopped
bloom
looked
at
the
head
of
a
horse
not
worth
anything
like
sixtyfive
guineas
suddenly
in
evidence
in
the
dark
quite
near
so
that
it
seemed
new
a
different
grouping
of
bones
and
even
flesh
because
palpably
it
was
a
fourwalker
a
hipshaker
a
blackbuttocker
a
taildangler
a
headhanger
putting
his
hind
foot
foremost
the
while
the
lord
of
his
creation
sat
on
the
perch
busy
with
his
thoughts
but
such
a
good
poor
brute
he
was
sorry
he
hadn
t
a
lump
of
sugar
but
as
he
wisely
reflected
you
could
scarcely
be
prepared
for
every
emergency
that
might
crop
up
he
was
just
a
big
nervous
foolish
noodly
kind
of
a
horse
without
a
second
care
in
the
world
but
even
a
dog
he
reflected
take
that
mongrel
in
barney
kiernan
s
of
the
same
size
would
be
a
holy
horror
to
face
but
it
was
no
animal
s
fault
in
particular
if
he
was
built
that
way
like
the
camel
ship
of
the
desert
distilling
grapes
into
potheen
in
his
hump
nine
tenths
of
them
all
could
be
caged
or
trained
nothing
beyond
the
art
of
man
barring
the
bees
whale
with
a
harpoon
hairpin
alligator
tickle
the
small
of
his
back
and
he
sees
the
joke
chalk
a
circle
for
a
rooster
tiger
my
eagle
eye
these
timely
reflections
anent
the
brutes
of
the
field
occupied
his
mind
somewhat
distracted
from
stephen
s
words
while
the
ship
of
the
street
was
manœuvring
and
stephen
went
on
about
the
highly
interesting
old
s
this
i
was
saying
ah
yes
my
wife
he
intimated
plunging
in
medias
res
would
have
the
greatest
of
pleasure
in
making
your
acquaintance
as
she
is
passionately
attached
to
music
of
any
kind
he
looked
sideways
in
a
friendly
fashion
at
the
sideface
of
stephen
image
of
his
mother
which
was
not
quite
the
same
as
the
usual
handsome
blackguard
type
they
unquestionably
had
an
insatiable
hankering
after
as
he
was
perhaps
not
that
way
built
still
supposing
he
had
his
father
s
gift
as
he
more
than
suspected
it
opened
up
new
vistas
in
his
mind
such
as
lady
fingall
s
irish
industries
concert
on
the
preceding
monday
and
aristocracy
in
general
exquisite
variations
he
was
now
describing
on
an
air
youth

jans
pieter
sweelinck
a
dutchman
of
amsterdam
where
the
frows
come
from
even
more
he
liked
an
old
german
song
of
johannes
jeep
about
the
clear
sea
and
the
voices
of
sirens
sweet
murderers
of
men
which
boggled
bloom
a

von

these
opening

he
sang
and
translated
extempore
bloom
nodding
said
he
perfectly
understood
and
begged
him
to
go
on
by
all
means
which
he
did
a
phenomenally
beautiful
tenor
voice
like
that
the
rarest
of
boons
which
bloom
appreciated
at
the
very
first
note
he
got
out
could
easily
if
properly
handled
by
some
recognised
authority
on
voice
production
such
as
barraclough
and
being
able
to
read
music
into
the
bargain
command
its
own
price
where
baritones
were
ten
a
penny
and
procure
for
its
fortunate
possessor
in
the
near
future
an
entrée
into
fashionable
houses
in
the
best
residential
quarters
of
financial
magnates
in
a
large
way
of
business
and
titled
people
where
with
his
university
degree
of
b
a
a
huge
ad
in
its
way
and
gentlemanly
bearing
to
all
the
more
influence
the
good
impression
he
would
infallibly
score
a
distinct
success
being
blessed
with
brains
which
also
could
be
utilised
for
the
purpose
and
other
requisites
if
his
clothes
were
properly
attended
to
so
as
to
the
better
worm
his
way
into
their
good
graces
as
he
a
youthful
tyro
in
society
s
sartorial
niceties
hardly
understood
how
a
little
thing
like
that
could
militate
against
you
it
was
in
fact
only
a
matter
of
months
and
he
could
easily
foresee
him
participating
in
their
musical
and
artistic
conversaziones
during
the
festivities
of
the
christmas
season
for
choice
causing
a
slight
flutter
in
the
dovecotes
of
the
fair
sex
and
being
made
a
lot
of
by
ladies
out
for
sensation
cases
of
which
as
he
happened
to
know
were
on
fact
without
giving
the
show
away
he
himself
once
upon
a
time
if
he
cared
to
could
easily
have
added
to
which
of
course
would
be
the
pecuniary
emolument
by
no
means
to
be
sneezed
at
going
hand
in
hand
with
his
tuition
fees
not
he
parenthesised
that
for
the
sake
of
filthy
lucre
he
need
necessarily
embrace
the
lyric
platform
as
a
walk
in
life
for
any
lengthy
space
of
time
but
a
step
in
the
required
direction
it
was
beyond
yea
or
nay
and
both
monetarily
and
mentally
it
contained
no
reflection
on
his
dignity
in
the
smallest
and
it
often
turned
in
uncommonly
handy
to
be
handed
a
cheque
at
a
muchneeded
moment
when
every
little
helped
besides
though
taste
latterly
had
deteriorated
to
a
degree
original
music
like
that
different
from
the
conventional
rut
would
rapidly
have
a
great
vogue
as
it
would
be
a
decided
novelty
for
dublin
s
musical
world
after
the
usual
hackneyed
run
of
catchy
tenor
solos
foisted
on
a
confiding
public
by
ivan
st
austell
and
hilton
st
just
and
their
genus
omne
yes
beyond
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
he
could
with
all
the
cards
in
his
hand
and
he
had
a
capital
opening
to
make
a
name
for
himself
and
win
a
high
place
in
the
city
s
esteem
where
he
could
command
a
stiff
figure
and
booking
ahead
give
a
grand
concert
for
the
patrons
of
the
king
street
house
given
a
backerup
if
one
were
forthcoming
to
kick
him
upstairs
so
to
speak
a
big
if
however
with
some
impetus
of
the
goahead
sort
to
obviate
the
inevitable
procrastination
which
often
tripped
up
a
too
much
fêted
prince
of
good
fellows
and
it
need
not
detract
from
the
other
by
one
iota
as
being
his
own
master
he
would
have
heaps
of
time
to
practise
literature
in
his
spare
moments
when
desirous
of
so
doing
without
its
clashing
with
his
vocal
career
or
containing
anything
derogatory
whatsoever
as
it
was
a
matter
for
himself
alone
in
fact
he
had
the
ball
at
his
feet
and
that
was
the
very
reason
why
the
other
possessed
of
a
remarkably
sharp
nose
for
smelling
a
rat
of
any
sort
hung
on
to
him
at
all
the
horse
was
just
then
and
later
on
at
a
propitious
opportunity
he
purposed
bloom
did
without
anyway
prying
into
his
private
affairs
on
the
fools
step
in
where
angels
principle
advising
him
to
sever
his
connection
with
a
certain
budding
practitioner
who
he
noticed
was
prone
to
disparage
and
even
to
a
slight
extent
with
some
hilarious
pretext
when
not
present
deprecate
him
or
whatever
you
like
to
call
it
which
in
bloom
s
humble
opinion
threw
a
nasty
sidelight
on
that
side
of
a
person
s
character
no
pun
intended
the
horse
having
reached
the
end
of
his
tether
so
to
speak
halted
and
rearing
high
a
proud
feathering
tail
added
his
quota
by
letting
fall
on
the
floor
which
the
brush
would
soon
brush
up
and
polish
three
smoking
globes
of
turds
slowly
three
times
one
after
another
from
a
full
crupper
he
mired
and
humanely
his
driver
waited
till
he
or
she
had
ended
patient
in
his
scythed
car
side

bloom
profiting
by
the
contretemps
with
stephen
passed
through
the
gap
of
the
chains
divided
by
the
upright
and
stepping
over
a
strand
of
mire
went
across
towards
gardiner
street
lower
stephen
singing
more
boldly
but
not
loudly
the
end
of
the
ballad
und
alle
schiffe
brücken
the
driver
never
said
a
word
good
bad
or
indifferent
but
merely
watched
the
two
figures
as
he
sat
on
his
lowbacked
car
both
black
one
full
one
lean
walk
towards
the
railway

by

maher
as
they
walked
they
at
times
stopped
and
walked
again
continuing
their
tête

which
of
course
he
was
utterly
out
of
about
sirens
enemies
of
man

reason
mingled
with
a
number
of
other
topics
of
the

while
the
man
in
the
sweeper

or
you
might
as
well
call
it
in
the
sleeper
car
who
in
any
case
couldn
t
possibly
hear
because
they
were
too
far
simply
sat
in
his
seat
near
the
end
of
lower
gardiner
street
and
looked
after
their
lowbacked
car
what
parallel
courses
did
bloom
and
stephen
follow
returning
starting
united
both
at
normal
walking
pace
from
beresford

they
followed
in
the
order
named

at

bearing

discover
common
factors
of
similarity
between
their
respective
like
and
unlike
reactions
to
experience
both
were
sensitive
to
artistic
impressions
musical
in
preference
to
plastic
or
pictorial
both
preferred
a
continental
to
an
insular
manner
of
life
a
cisatlantic
to
a
transatlantic
place
of
residence
both
indurated
by
early
domestic
training
and
an
inherited
tenacity
of
heterodox
resistance
professed
their
disbelief
in
many
orthodox
religious
national
social
and
ethical
doctrines
both
admitted
the
alternately
stimulating
and
obtunding
influence
of
heterosexual
magnetism
were
their
views
on
some
points
divergent
stephen
dissented
openly
from

s
views
on
the
importance
of

and

selfhelp
while
bloom
dissented
tacitly
from
stephen
s
views
on
the
eternal
affirmation
of
the
spirit
of
man
in
literature
bloom
assented
covertly
to
stephen
s
rectification
of
the
anachronism
involved
in
assigning
the
date
of
the
conversion
of

deglutition

at

interred

the

bloom
ascribed
to
gastric
inanition
and
certain
chemical
compounds
of
varying
degrees
of
adulteration
and
alcoholic
strength
accelerated
by
mental
exertion
and
the
velocity
of
rapid
circular
motion
in
a
relaxing
atmosphere
stephen
attributed
to
the
reapparition
of
a
matutinal
cloud
perceived
by
both
from
two
different
points
of
observation
sandycove
and
dublin
at

no

what
reflection
concerning
the
irregular
sequence

did
bloom
make
before

he
reflected
that
the
progressive

was
regressively
accompanied
by
a
restriction
of

that

did
their
conversation
on
the
subject
of
these
reminiscences
reveal
a
third
connecting
link
between

mrs
riordan
dante
a
widow
of
independent
means
had
resided
in
the
house
of
stephen
s
parents
from
september
to
december
and
had
also
resided
during
the
years
and
in
the
city
arms
hotel
owned
by
elizabeth
o
dowd
of
prussia
street
where
during
parts
of
the
years
and
she
had
been
a
constant
informant
of
bloom
who
resided
also
in
the
same
hotel
being
at
that
time
a
clerk
in
the
employment
of
joseph
cuffe
of
smithfield
for
the
superintendence
of
sales
in
the
adjacent
dublin
cattle
market
on
the
north
circular
road
had
he
performed
any
special
corporal
work
of
mercy
for
her
he
had
sometimes
propelled
her
on
warm
summer
evenings
an
infirm
widow
of
independent
if
limited
means
in
her
convalescent
bathchair
with
slow
revolutions
of
its
wheels
as
far
as
the
corner
of
the
north
circular
road
opposite
mr
gavin
low
s
place
of
business
where
she
had
remained
for
a
certain
time
scanning
through
his
onelensed
binocular
fieldglasses
unrecognisable
citizens
on
tramcars
roadster
bicycles
equipped
with
inflated
pneumatic
tyres
hackney
carriages
tandems
private
and
hired
landaus
dogcarts
ponytraps
and
brakes
passing
from
the
city
to
the
phœnix
park
and
why
could
he
then
support
that
his
vigil
with
the
greater
equanimity
because
in
middle
youth
he
had
often
sat
observing
through
a
rondel
of
bossed
glass
of
a
multicoloured
pane
the
spectacle
offered
with
continual
changes
of
the
thoroughfare
without
pedestrians
quadrupeds
velocipedes
vehicles
passing
slowly
quickly
evenly
round
and
round
and
round
the
rim
of
a
round
and
round
precipitous
globe
what
distinct
different
memories
had
each
of
her
now
eight
years
deceased
the
older
her
bezique
cards
and
counters
her
skye
terrier
her
suppositious
wealth
her
lapses
of
responsiveness
and
incipient
catarrhal
deafness
the
younger
her
lamp
of
colza
oil
before
the
statue
of
the
immaculate
conception
her
green
and
maroon
brushes
for
charles
stewart
parnell
and
for
michael
davitt
her
tissue
papers
were
there
no
means
still
remaining
to
him
to
achieve
the
rejuvenation
which
these
reminiscences
divulged
to
a
younger
companion
rendered
the
more
desirable
the
indoor
exercises
formerly
intermittently
practised
subsequently
abandoned
prescribed
in
eugen
sandow
s
physical
strength
and
how
to
obtain
it
which
designed
particularly
for
commercial
men
engaged
in
sedentary
occupations
were
to
be
made
with
mental
concentration
in
front
of
a
mirror
so
as
to
bring
into
play
the
various
families
of
muscles
and
produce
successively
a
pleasant
rigidity
a
more
pleasant
relaxation
and
the
most
pleasant
repristination
of
juvenile
agility
had
any
special
agility
been
his
in
earlier
youth
though
ringweight
lifting
had
been
beyond
his
strength
and
the
full
circle
gyration
beyond
his
courage
yet
as
a
high
school
scholar
he
had
excelled
in
his
stable
and
protracted
execution
of
the
half
lever
movement
on
the
parallel
bars
in
consequence
of
his
abnormally
developed
abdominal
muscles
did
either
openly
allude
to
their
racial
difference
neither
what
reduced

their

reciprocal

have
passed

through

grades
of
the
intermediate
and
through
the
matriculation
first
arts

arts
and

degree
courses
of
the
royal
university
why
did
bloom
refrain
from
stating
that
he
had
frequented
the
university
of
life
because
of
his
fluctuating
incertitude
as
to
whether
this
observation
had
or
had
not
been
already
made
by
him
to
stephen
or
by
stephen
to
him
what
two
temperaments
did
they
individually
represent
the
scientific
the
artistic
what
proofs
did
bloom
adduce
to
prove
that
his
tendency
was
towards
applied
rather
than
towards
pure
science
certain
possible
inventions
of
which
he
had
cogitated
when
reclining
in
a
state
of
supine
repletion
to
aid
digestion
stimulated
by
his
appreciation
of
the
importance
of
inventions
now
common
but
once
revolutionary
for
example
the
aeronautic
parachute
the
reflecting
telescope
the
spiral
corkscrew
the
safety
pin
the
mineral
water
siphon
the
canal
lock
with
winch
and
sluice
the
suction
pump
were
these
inventions
principally
intended
for
an
improved
scheme
of
kindergarten

rendering
obsolete
popguns
elastic

it
leads
him

to

there
implacable
immolates
him

why
was

not

not

unresisting
still
in

with

why
might
these
several

contingencies
between

and

not
necessarily
preclude
or
be
precluded
by
a
permanent
eventuality
of
reconciliatory
union
between

because
the
way
to

led
through

the

to
what
inconsequent
polysyllabic
question
of

the

return

monosyllabic
negative
answer
if
he
had
known
the
late

what

what
rendered
problematic
for
bloom
the
realisation
of
these
mutually
selfexcluding
propositions
the
irreparability
of
the
past
once
at
a
performance
of
albert
hengler
s
circus
in
the
rotunda
rutland
square
dublin
an
intuitive
particoloured
clown
in
quest
of
paternity
had
penetrated
from
the
ring
to
a
place
in
the
auditorium
where
bloom
solitary
was
seated
and
had
publicly
declared
to
an
exhilarated
audience
that
he
bloom
was
his
the
clown
s
papa
the
imprevidibility
of
the
future
once
in
the
summer
of
he
bloom
had
marked
a
florin
with
three
notches
on
the
milled
edge
and
tendered
it
in
payment
of
an
account
due
to
and
received
by

davy

for

on

for
possible
circuitous

was
the
clown
bloom
s
son
no
had
bloom
s
coin
returned
never
why
would
a
recurrent
frustration
the
more
depress
him
because
at
the
critical
turningpoint
of
human
existence
he
desired
to
amend
many
social
conditions
the
product
of
inequality
and
avarice
and
international
animosity
he
believed
then
that
human
life
was
infinitely
perfectible
eliminating
these
conditions
there
remained
the
generic
conditions
imposed
by
natural
as
distinct
from
human
law
as
integral
parts
of
the
human
whole
the
necessity
of
destruction
to
procure
alimentary
sustenance
the
painful
character
of
the
ultimate
functions
of
separate
existence
the
agonies
of
birth
and
death
the
monotonous
menstruation
of
simian
and
particularly
human
females
extending
from
the
age
of
puberty
to

menopause

are
located
in
densely
populated
regions
the
fact
of
vital
growth
through
convulsions
of
metamorphosis
from
infancy
through
maturity
to
decay
why
did
he
desist
from
speculation
because
it
was
a
task
for
a
superior
intelligence
to
substitute
other
more
acceptable
phenomena
in
the
place
of
the
less
acceptable
phenomena
to
be
removed
did
stephen
participate
in
his
dejection
he
affirmed
his
significance
as
a
conscious
rational
animal
proceeding
syllogistically
from
the
known
to
the
unknown
and
a
conscious
rational
reagent
between
a
micro
and
a
macrocosm
ineluctably
constructed
upon
the
incertitude
of
the
void
was
this
affirmation
apprehended
by
bloom
not
verbally
substantially
what
comforted
his
misapprehension
that
as
a
competent
keyless
citizen
he
had
proceeded
energetically
from
the
unknown
to
the
known
through
the
incertitude
of
the
void
in
what
order
of
precedence
with
what
attendant

constellated

each

ever
diminishing
without

till
if
the
progress
were
carried
far
enough
nought
nowhere
was
never
reached
why
did
he
not
elaborate
these
calculations
to
a
more
precise
result
because
some
years
previously
in
when
occupied
with
the
problem
of
the
quadrature
of
the
circle
he
had
learned
of
the
existence
of
a
number
computed
to
a
relative
degree
of
accuracy
to
be
of
such
magnitude
and
of
so

of

the

having
been
obtained
closely
printed

did
he
find
the
problems
of
the
inhabitability
of
the

and
their

by
a
race
given
in

and
of
the

of

by

easier
of

of

that

of
sustaining
an

of

was
approximated
from

and

when
proposing
this
problem
for

he
had
conjectured
as
a
working
hypothesis
which
could
not
be
proved

that
a

before
its

spectators
had
entered

was
he
more
convinced
of
the
esthetic
value
of
the
spectacle
indubitably
in
consequence
of
the
reiterated
examples
of
poets
in
the
delirium
of
the
frenzy
of
attachment
or
in
the
abasement
of
rejection
invoking
ardent
sympathetic
constellations
or
the
frigidity
of
the
satellite
of
their
planet
did
he
then
accept
as
an
article
of
belief
the
theory
of
astrological
influences
upon
sublunary
disasters
it
seemed
to
him
as
possible
of
proof
as
of
confutation

accompanied
the

the

night
of
the
bed
of
all
the
auks
of
the
rocs
of
darkinbad
the
brightdayler
where
yes
because
he
never
did
a
thing
like
that
before
as
ask
to
get
his
breakfast
in
bed
with
a
couple
of
eggs
since
the
city
arms
hotel
when
he
used
to
be
pretending
to
be
laid
up
with
a
sick
voice
doing
his
highness
to
make
himself
interesting
for
that
old
faggot
mrs
riordan
that
he
thought
he
had
a
great
leg
of
and
she
never
left
us
a
farthing
all
for
masses
for
herself
and
her
soul
greatest
miser
ever
was
actually
afraid
to
lay
out
for
her
methylated
spirit
telling
me
all
her
ailments
she
had
too
much
old
chat
in
her
about
politics
and
earthquakes
and
the
end
of
the
world
let
us
have
a
bit
of
fun
first
god
help
the
world
if
all
the
women
were
her
sort
down
on
bathingsuits
and
lownecks
of
course
nobody
wanted
her
to
wear
them
i
suppose
she
was
pious
because
no
man
would
look
at
her
twice
i
hope
ill
never
be
like
her
a
wonder
she
didnt
want
us
to
cover
our
faces
but
she
was
a
welleducated
woman
certainly
and
her
gabby
talk
about
mr
riordan
here
and
mr
riordan
there
i
suppose
he
was
glad
to
get
shut
of
her
and
her
dog
smelling
my
fur
and
always
edging
to
get
up
under
my
petticoats
especially
then
still
i
like
that
in
him
polite
to
old
women
like
that
and
waiters
and
beggars
too
hes
not
proud
out
of
nothing
but
not
always
if
ever
he
got
anything
really
serious
the
matter
with
him
its
much
better
for
them
to
go
into
a
hospital
where
everything
is
clean
but
i
suppose
id
have
to
dring
it
into
him
for
a
month
yes
and
then
wed
have
a
hospital
nurse
next
thing
on
the
carpet
have
him
staying
there
till
they
throw
him
out
or
a
nun
maybe
like
the
smutty
photo
he
has
shes
as
much
a
nun
as
im
not
yes
because
theyre
so
weak
and
puling
when
theyre
sick
they
want
a
woman
to
get
well
if
his
nose
bleeds
youd
think
it
was
o
tragic
and
that
dyinglooking
one
off
the
south
circular
when
he
sprained
his
foot
at
the
choir
party
at
the
sugarloaf
mountain
the
day
i
wore
that
dress
miss
stack
bringing
him
flowers
the
worst
old
ones
she
could
find
at
the
bottom
of
the
basket
anything
at
all
to
get
into
a
mans
bedroom
with
her
old
maids
voice
trying
to
imagine
he
was
dying
on
account
of
her
to
never
see
thy
face
again
though
he
looked
more
like
a
man
with
his
beard
a
bit
grown
in
the
bed
father
was
the
same
besides
i
hate
bandaging
and
dosing
when
he
cut
his
toe
with
the
razor
paring
his
corns
afraid
hed
get
bloodpoisoning
but
if
it
was
a
thing
i
was
sick
then
wed
see
what
attention
only
of
course
the
woman
hides
it
not
to
give
all
the
trouble
they
do
yes
he
came
somewhere
im
sure
by
his
appetite
anyway
love
its
not
or
hed
be
off
his
feed
thinking
of
her
so
either
it
was
one
of
those
night
women
if
it
was
down
there
he
was
really
and
the
hotel
story
he
made
up
a
pack
of
lies
to
hide
it
planning
it
hynes
kept
me
who
did
i
meet
ah
yes
i
met
do
you
remember
menton
and
who
else
who
let
me
see
that
big
babbyface
i
saw
him
and
he
not
long
married
flirting
with
a
young
girl
at
pooles
myriorama
and
turned
my
back
on
him
when
he
slinked
out
looking
quite
conscious
what
harm
but
he
had
the
impudence
to
make
up
to
me
one
time
well
done
to
him
mouth
almighty
and
his
boiled
eyes
of
all
the
big
stupoes
i
ever
met
and
thats
called
a
solicitor
only
for
i
hate
having
a
long
wrangle
in
bed
or
else
if
its
not
that
its
some
little
bitch
or
other
he
got
in
with
somewhere
or
picked
up
on
the
sly
if
they
only
knew
him
as
well
as
i
do
yes
because
the
day
before
yesterday
he
was
scribbling
something
a
letter
when
i
came
into
the
front
room
to
show
him
dignams
death
in
the
paper
as
if
something
told
me
and
he
covered
it
up
with
the
blottingpaper
pretending
to
be
thinking
about
business
so
very
probably
that
was
it
to
somebody
who
thinks
she
has
a
softy
in
him
because
all
men
get
a
bit
like
that
at
his
age
especially
getting
on
to
forty
he
is
now
so
as
to
wheedle
any
money
she
can
out
of
him
no
fool
like
an
old
fool
and
then
the
usual
kissing
my
bottom
was
to
hide
it
not
that
i
care
two
straws
now
who
he
does
it
with
or
knew
before
that
way
though
id
like
to
find
out
so
long
as
i
dont
have
the
two
of
them
under
my
nose
all
the
time
like
that
slut
that
mary
we
had
in
ontario
terrace
padding
out
her
false
bottom
to
excite
him
bad
enough
to
get
the
smell
of
those
painted
women
off
him
once
or
twice
i
had
a
suspicion
by
getting
him
to
come
near
me
when
i
found
the
long
hair
on
his
coat
without
that
one
when
i
went
into
the
kitchen
pretending
he
was
drinking
water
woman
is
not
enough
for
them
it
was
all
his
fault
of
course
ruining
servants
then
proposing
that
she
could
eat
at
our
table
on
christmas
day
if
you
please
o
no
thank
you
not
in
my
house
stealing
my
potatoes
and
the
oysters
per
doz
going
out
to
see
her
aunt
if
you
please
common
robbery
so
it
was
but
i
was
sure
he
had
something
on
with
that
one
it
takes
me
to
find
out
a
thing
like
that
he
said
you
have
no
proof
it
was
her
proof
o
yes
her
aunt
was
very
fond
of
oysters
but
i
told
her
what
i
thought
of
her
suggesting
me
to
go
out
to
be
alone
with
her
i
wouldnt
lower
myself
to
spy
on
them
the
garters
i
found
in
her
room
the
friday
she
was
out
that
was
enough
for
me
a
little
bit
too
much
her
face
swelled
up
on
her
with
temper
when
i
gave
her
her
weeks
notice
i
saw
to
that
better
do
without
them
altogether
do
out
the
rooms
myself
quicker
only
for
the
damn
cooking
and
throwing
out
the
dirt
i
gave
it
to
him
anyhow
either
she
or
me
leaves
the
house
i
couldnt
even
touch
him
if
i
thought
he
was
with
a
dirty
barefaced
liar
and
sloven
like
that
one
denying
it
up
to
my
face
and
singing
about
the
place
in
the
w
c
too
because
she
knew
she
was
too
well
off
yes
because
he
couldnt
possibly
do
without
it
that
long
so
he
must
do
it
somewhere
and
the
last
time
he
came
on
my
bottom
when
was
it
the
night
boylan
gave
my
hand
a
great
squeeze
going
along
by
the
tolka
in
my
hand
there
steals
another
i
just
pressed
the
back
of
his
like
that
with
my
thumb
to
squeeze
back
singing
the
young
may
moon
shes
beaming
love
because
he
has
an
idea
about
him
and
me
hes
not
such
a
fool
he
said
im
dining
out
and
going
to
the
gaiety
though
im
not
going
to
give
him
the
satisfaction
in
any
case
god
knows
hes
a
change
in
a
way
not
to
be
always
and
ever
wearing
the
same
old
hat
unless
i
paid
some
nicelooking
boy
to
do
it
since
i
cant
do
it
myself
a
young
boy
would
like
me
id
confuse
him
a
little
alone
with
him
if
we
were
id
let
him
see
my
garters
the
new
ones
and
make
him
turn
red
looking
at
him
seduce
him
i
know
what
boys
feel
with
that
down
on
their
cheek
doing
that
frigging
drawing
out
the
thing
by
the
hour
question
and
answer
would
you
do
this
that
and
the
other
with
the
coalman
yes
with
a
bishop
yes
i
would
because
i
told
him
about
some
dean
or
bishop
was
sitting
beside
me
in
the
jews
temples
gardens
when
i
was
knitting
that
woollen
thing
a
stranger
to
dublin
what
place
was
it
and
so
on
about
the
monuments
and
he
tired
me
out
with
statues
encouraging
him
making
him
worse
than
he
is
who
is
in
your
mind
now
tell
me
who
are
you
thinking
of
who
is
it
tell
me
his
name
who
tell
me
who
the
german
emperor
is
it
yes
imagine
im
him
think
of
him
can
you
feel
him
trying
to
make
a
whore
of
me
what
he
never
will
he
ought
to
give
it
up
now
at
this
age
of
his
life
simply
ruination
for
any
woman
and
no
satisfaction
in
it
pretending
to
like
it
till
he
comes
and
then
finish
it
off
myself
anyway
and
it
makes
your
lips
pale
anyhow
its
done
now
once
and
for
all
with
all
the
talk
of
the
world
about
it
people
make
its
only
the
first
time
after
that
its
just
the
ordinary
do
it
and
think
no
more
about
it
why
cant
you
kiss
a
man
without
going
and
marrying
him
first
you
sometimes
love
to
wildly
when
you
feel
that
way
so
nice
all
over
you
you
cant
help
yourself
i
wish
some
man
or
other
would
take
me
sometime
when
hes
there
and
kiss
me
in
his
arms
theres
nothing
like
a
kiss
long
and
hot
down
to
your
soul
almost
paralyses
you
then
i
hate
that
confession
when
i
used
to
go
to
father
corrigan
he
touched
me
father
and
what
harm
if
he
did
where
and
i
said
on
the
canal
bank
like
a
fool
but
whereabouts
on
your
person
my
child
on
the
leg
behind
high
up
was
it
yes
rather
high
up
was
it
where
you
sit
down
yes
o
lord
couldnt
he
say
bottom
right
out
and
have
done
with
it
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
it
and
did
you
whatever
way
he
put
it
i
forget
no
father
and
i
always
think
of
the
real
father
what
did
he
want
to
know
for
when
i
already
confessed
it
to
god
he
had
a
nice
fat
hand
the
palm
moist
always
i
wouldnt
mind
feeling
it
neither
would
he
id
say
by
the
bullneck
in
his
horsecollar
i
wonder
did
he
know
me
in
the
box
i
could
see
his
face
he
couldnt
see
mine
of
course
hed
never
turn
or
let
on
still
his
eyes
were
red
when
his
father
died
theyre
lost
for
a
woman
of
course
must
be
terrible
when
a
man
cries
let
alone
them
id
like
to
be
embraced
by
one
in
his
vestments
and
the
smell
of
incense
off
him
like
the
pope
besides
theres
no
danger
with
a
priest
if
youre
married
hes
too
careful
about
himself
then
give
something
to
h
h
the
pope
for
a
penance
i
wonder
was
he
satisfied
with
me
one
thing
i
didnt
like
his
slapping
me
behind
going
away
so
familiarly
in
the
hall
though
i
laughed
im
not
a
horse
or
an
ass
am
i
i
suppose
he
was
thinking
of
his
fathers
i
wonder
is
he
awake
thinking
of
me
or
dreaming
am
i
in
it
who
gave
him
that
flower
he
said
he
bought
he
smelt
of
some
kind
of
drink
not
whisky
or
stout
or
perhaps
the
sweety
kind
of
paste
they
stick
their
bills
up
with
some
liqueur
id
like
to
sip
those
richlooking
green
and
yellow
expensive
drinks
those
stagedoor
johnnies
drink
with
the
opera
hats
i
tasted
once
with
my
finger
dipped
out
of
that
american
that
had
the
squirrel
talking
stamps
with
father
he
had
all
he
could
do
to
keep
himself
from
falling
asleep
after
the
last
time
after
we
took
the
port
and
potted
meat
it
had
a
fine
salty
taste
yes
because
i
felt
lovely
and
tired
myself
and
fell
asleep
as
sound
as
a
top
the
moment
i
popped
straight
into
bed
till
that
thunder
woke
me
up
god
be
merciful
to
us
i
thought
the
heavens
were
coming
down
about
us
to
punish
us
when
i
blessed
myself
and
said
a
hail
mary
like
those
awful
thunderbolts
in
gibraltar
as
if
the
world
was
coming
to
an
end
and
then
they
come
and
tell
you
theres
no
god
what
could
you
do
if
it
was
running
and
rushing
about
nothing
only
make
an
act
of
contrition
the
candle
i
lit
that
evening
in
whitefriars
street
chapel
for
the
month
of
may
see
it
brought
its
luck
though
hed
scoff
if
he
heard
because
he
never
goes
to
church
mass
or
meeting
he
says
your
soul
you
have
no
soul
inside
only
grey
matter
because
he
doesnt
know
what
it
is
to
have
one
yes
when
i
lit
the
lamp
because
he
must
have
come
or
times
with
that
tremendous
big
red
brute
of
a
thing
he
has
i
thought
the
vein
or
whatever
the
dickens
they
call
it
was
going
to
burst
though
his
nose
is
not
so
big
after
i
took
off
all
my
things
with
the
blinds
down
after
my
hours
dressing
and
perfuming
and
combing
it
like
iron
or
some
kind
of
a
thick
crowbar
standing
all
the
time
he
must
have
eaten
oysters
i
think
a
few
dozen
he
was
in
great
singing
voice
no
i
never
in
all
my
life
felt
anyone
had
one
the
size
of
that
to
make
you
feel
full
up
he
must
have
eaten
a
whole
sheep
after
whats
the
idea
making
us
like
that
with
a
big
hole
in
the
middle
of
us
or
like
a
stallion
driving
it
up
into
you
because
thats
all
they
want
out
of
you
with
that
determined
vicious
look
in
his
eye
i
had
to
halfshut
my
eyes
still
he
hasnt
such
a
tremendous
amount
of
spunk
in
him
when
i
made
him
pull
out
and
do
it
on
me
considering
how
big
it
is
so
much
the
better
in
case
any
of
it
wasnt
washed
out
properly
the
last
time
i
let
him
finish
it
in
me
nice
invention
they
made
for
women
for
him
to
get
all
the
pleasure
but
if
someone
gave
them
a
touch
of
it
themselves
theyd
know
what
i
went
through
with
milly
nobody
would
believe
cutting
her
teeth
too
and
mina
purefoys
husband
give
us
a
swing
out
of
your
whiskers
filling
her
up
with
a
child
or
twins
once
a
year
as
regular
as
the
clock
always
with
a
smell
of
children
off
her
the
one
they
called
budgers
or
something
like
a
nigger
with
a
shock
of
hair
on
it
jesusjack
the
child
is
a
black
the
last
time
i
was
there
a
squad
of
them
falling
over
one
another
and
bawling
you
couldnt
hear
your
ears
supposed
to
be
healthy
not
satisfied
till
they
have
us
swollen
out
like
elephants
or
i
dont
know
what
supposing
i
risked
having
another
not
off
him
though
still
if
he
was
married
im
sure
hed
have
a
fine
strong
child
but
i
dont
know
poldy
has
more
spunk
in
him
yes
thatd
be
awfully
jolly
i
suppose
it
was
meeting
josie
powell
and
the
funeral
and
thinking
about
me
and
boylan
set
him
off
well
he
can
think
what
he
likes
now
if
thatll
do
him
any
good
i
know
they
were
spooning
a
bit
when
i
came
on
the
scene
he
was
dancing
and
sitting
out
with
her
the
night
of
georgina
simpsons
housewarming
and
then
he
wanted
to
ram
it
down
my
neck
it
was
on
account
of
not
liking
to
see
her
a
wallflower
that
was
why
we
had
the
standup
row
over
politics
he
began
it
not
me
when
he
said
about
our
lord
being
a
carpenter
at
last
he
made
me
cry
of
course
a
woman
is
so
sensitive
about
everything
i
was
fuming
with
myself
after
for
giving
in
only
for
i
knew
he
was
gone
on
me
and
the
first
socialist
he
said
he
was
he
annoyed
me
so
much
i
couldnt
put
him
into
a
temper
still
he
knows
a
lot
of
mixedup
things
especially
about
the
body
and
the
inside
i
often
wanted
to
study
up
that
myself
what
we
have
inside
us
in
that
family
physician
i
could
always
hear
his
voice
talking
when
the
room
was
crowded
and
watch
him
after
that
i
pretended
i
had
a
coolness
on
with
her
over
him
because
he
used
to
be
a
bit
on
the
jealous
side
whenever
he
asked
who
are
you
going
to
and
i
said
over
to
floey
and
he
made
me
the
present
of
byrons
poems
and
the
three
pairs
of
gloves
so
that
finished
that
i
could
quite
easily
get
him
to
make
it
up
any
time
i
know
how
id
even
supposing
he
got
in
with
her
again
and
was
going
out
to
see
her
somewhere
id
know
if
he
refused
to
eat
the
onions
i
know
plenty
of
ways
ask
him
to
tuck
down
the
collar
of
my
blouse
or
touch
him
with
my
veil
and
gloves
on
going
out
kiss
then
would
send
them
all
spinning
however
alright
well
see
then
let
him
go
to
her
she
of
course
would
only
be
too
delighted
to
pretend
shes
mad
in
love
with
him
that
i
wouldnt
so
much
mind
id
just
go
to
her
and
ask
her
do
you
love
him
and
look
her
square
in
the
eyes
she
couldnt
fool
me
but
he
might
imagine
he
was
and
make
a
declaration
to
her
with
his
plabbery
kind
of
a
manner
like
he
did
to
me
though
i
had
the
devils
own
job
to
get
it
out
of
him
though
i
liked
him
for
that
it
showed
he
could
hold
in
and
wasnt
to
be
got
for
the
asking
he
was
on
the
pop
of
asking
me
too
the
night
in
the
kitchen
i
was
rolling
the
potato
cake
theres
something
i
want
to
say
to
you
only
for
i
put
him
off
letting
on
i
was
in
a
temper
with
my
hands
and
arms
full
of
pasty
flour
in
any
case
i
let
out
too
much
the
night
before
talking
of
dreams
so
i
didnt
want
to
let
him
know
more
than
was
good
for
him
she
used
to
be
always
embracing
me
josie
whenever
he
was
there
meaning
him
of
course
glauming
me
over
and
when
i
said
i
washed
up
and
down
as
far
as
possible
asking
me
and
did
you
wash
possible
the
women
are
always
egging
on
to
that
putting
it
on
thick
when
hes
there
they
know
by
his
sly
eye
blinking
a
bit
putting
on
the
indifferent
when
they
come
out
with
something
the
kind
he
is
what
spoils
him
i
dont
wonder
in
the
least
because
he
was
very
handsome
at
that
time
trying
to
look
like
lord
byron
i
said
i
liked
though
he
was
too
beautiful
for
a
man
and
he
was
a
little
before
we
got
engaged
afterwards
though
she
didnt
like
it
so
much
the
day
i
was
in
fits
of
laughing
with
the
giggles
i
couldnt
stop
about
all
my
hairpins
falling
out
one
after
another
with
the
mass
of
hair
i
had
youre
always
in
great
humour
she
said
yes
because
it
grigged
her
because
she
knew
what
it
meant
because
i
used
to
tell
her
a
good
bit
of
what
went
on
between
us
not
all
but
just
enough
to
make
her
mouth
water
but
that
wasnt
my
fault
she
didnt
darken
the
door
much
after
we
were
married
i
wonder
what
shes
got
like
now
after
living
with
that
dotty
husband
of
hers
she
had
her
face
beginning
to
look
drawn
and
run
down
the
last
time
i
saw
her
she
must
have
been
just
after
a
row
with
him
because
i
saw
on
the
moment
she
was
edging
to
draw
down
a
conversation
about
husbands
and
talk
about
him
to
run
him
down
what
was
it
she
told
me
o
yes
that
sometimes
he
used
to
go
to
bed
with
his
muddy
boots
on
when
the
maggot
takes
him
just
imagine
having
to
get
into
bed
with
a
thing
like
that
that
might
murder
you
any
moment
what
a
man
well
its
not
the
one
way
everyone
goes
mad
poldy
anyhow
whatever
he
does
always
wipes
his
feet
on
the
mat
when
he
comes
in
wet
or
shine
and
always
blacks
his
own
boots
too
and
he
always
takes
off
his
hat
when
he
comes
up
in
the
street
like
then
and
now
hes
going
about
in
his
slippers
to
look
for
for
a
postcard
u
p
up
o
sweetheart
may
wouldnt
a
thing
like
that
simply
bore
you
stiff
to
extinction
actually
too
stupid
even
to
take
his
boots
off
now
what
could
you
make
of
a
man
like
that
id
rather
die
times
over
than
marry
another
of
their
sex
of
course
hed
never
find
another
woman
like
me
to
put
up
with
him
the
way
i
do
know
me
come
sleep
with
me
yes
and
he
knows
that
too
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
take
that
mrs
maybrick
that
poisoned
her
husband
for
what
i
wonder
in
love
with
some
other
man
yes
it
was
found
out
on
her
wasnt
she
the
downright
villain
to
go
and
do
a
thing
like
that
of
course
some
men
can
be
dreadfully
aggravating
drive
you
mad
and
always
the
worst
word
in
the
world
what
do
they
ask
us
to
marry
them
for
if
were
so
bad
as
all
that
comes
to
yes
because
they
cant
get
on
without
us
white
arsenic
she
put
in
his
tea
off
flypaper
wasnt
it
i
wonder
why
they
call
it
that
if
i
asked
him
hed
say
its
from
the
greek
leave
us
as
wise
as
we
were
before
she
must
have
been
madly
in
love
with
the
other
fellow
to
run
the
chance
of
being
hanged
o
she
didnt
care
if
that
was
her
nature
what
could
she
do
besides
theyre
not
brutes
enough
to
go
and
hang
a
woman
surely
are
they
theyre
all
so
different
boylan
talking
about
the
shape
of
my
foot
he
noticed
at
once
even
before
he
was
introduced
when
i
was
in
the
d
b
c
with
poldy
laughing
and
trying
to
listen
i
was
waggling
my
foot
we
both
ordered
teas
and
plain
bread
and
butter
i
saw
him
looking
with
his
two
old
maids
of
sisters
when
i
stood
up
and
asked
the
girl
where
it
was
what
do
i
care
with
it
dropping
out
of
me
and
that
black
closed
breeches
he
made
me
buy
takes
you
half
an
hour
to
let
them
down
wetting
all
myself
always
with
some
brandnew
fad
every
other
week
such
a
long
one
i
did
i
forgot
my
suede
gloves
on
the
seat
behind
that
i
never
got
after
some
robber
of
a
woman
and
he
wanted
me
to
put
it
in
the
irish
times
lost
in
the
ladies
lavatory
d
b
c
dame
street
finder
return
to
mrs
marion
bloom
and
i
saw
his
eyes
on
my
feet
going
out
through
the
turning
door
he
was
looking
when
i
looked
back
and
i
went
there
for
tea
days
after
in
the
hope
but
he
wasnt
now
how
did
that
excite
him
because
i
was
crossing
them
when
we
were
in
the
other
room
first
he
meant
the
shoes
that
are
too
tight
to
walk
in
my
hand
is
nice
like
that
if
i
only
had
a
ring
with
the
stone
for
my
month
a
nice
aquamarine
ill
stick
him
for
one
and
a
gold
bracelet
i
dont
like
my
foot
so
much
still
i
made
him
spend
once
with
my
foot
the
night
after
goodwins
botchup
of
a
concert
so
cold
and
windy
it
was
well
we
had
that
rum
in
the
house
to
mull
and
the
fire
wasnt
black
out
when
he
asked
to
take
off
my
stockings
lying
on
the
hearthrug
in
lombard
street
west
and
another
time
it
was
my
muddy
boots
hed
like
me
to
walk
in
all
the
horses
dung
i
could
find
but
of
course
hes
not
natural
like
the
rest
of
the
world
that
i
what
did
he
say
i
could
give
points
in
to
katty
lanner
and
beat
her
what
does
that
mean
i
asked
him
i
forget
what
he
said
because
the
stoppress
edition
just
passed
and
the
man
with
the
curly
hair
in
the
lucan
dairy
thats
so
polite
i
think
i
saw
his
face
before
somewhere
i
noticed
him
when
i
was
tasting
the
butter
so
i
took
my
time
bartell
darcy
too
that
he
used
to
make
fun
of
when
he
commenced
kissing
me
on
the
choir
stairs
after
i
sang
gounods
ave
maria
what
are
we
waiting
for
o
my
heart
kiss
me
straight
on
the
brow
and
part
which
is
my
brown
part
he
was
pretty
hot
for
all
his
tinny
voice
too
my
low
notes
he
was
always
raving
about
if
you
can
believe
him
i
liked
the
way
he
used
his
mouth
singing
then
he
said
wasnt
it
terrible
to
do
that
there
in
a
place
like
that
i
dont
see
anything
so
terrible
about
it
ill
tell
him
about
that
some
day
not
now
and
surprise
him
ay
and
ill
take
him
there
and
show
him
the
very
place
too
we
did
it
so
now
there
you
are
like
it
or
lump
it
he
thinks
nothing
can
happen
without
him
knowing
he
hadnt
an
idea
about
my
mother
till
we
were
engaged
otherwise
hed
never
have
got
me
so
cheap
as
he
did
he
was
times
worse
himself
anyhow
begging
me
to
give
him
a
tiny
bit
cut
off
my
drawers
that
was
the
evening
coming
along
kenilworth
square
he
kissed
me
in
the
eye
of
my
glove
and
i
had
to
take
it
off
asking
me
questions
is
it
permitted
to
enquire
the
shape
of
my
bedroom
so
i
let
him
keep
it
as
if
i
forgot
it
to
think
of
me
when
i
saw
him
slip
it
into
his
pocket
of
course
hes
mad
on
the
subject
of
drawers
thats
plain
to
be
seen
always
skeezing
at
those
brazenfaced
things
on
the
bicycles
with
their
skirts
blowing
up
to
their
navels
even
when
milly
and
i
were
out
with
him
at
the
open
air
fete
that
one
in
the
cream
muslin
standing
right
against
the
sun
so
he
could
see
every
atom
she
had
on
when
he
saw
me
from
behind
following
in
the
rain
i
saw
him
before
he
saw
me
however
standing
at
the
corner
of
the
harolds
cross
road
with
a
new
raincoat
on
him
with
the
muffler
in
the
zingari
colours
to
show
off
his
complexion
and
the
brown
hat
looking
slyboots
as
usual
what
was
he
doing
there
where
hed
no
business
they
can
go
and
get
whatever
they
like
from
anything
at
all
with
a
skirt
on
it
and
were
not
to
ask
any
questions
but
they
want
to
know
where
were
you
where
are
you
going
i
could
feel
him
coming
along
skulking
after
me
his
eyes
on
my
neck
he
had
been
keeping
away
from
the
house
he
felt
it
was
getting
too
warm
for
him
so
i
halfturned
and
stopped
then
he
pestered
me
to
say
yes
till
i
took
off
my
glove
slowly
watching
him
he
said
my
openwork
sleeves
were
too
cold
for
the
rain
anything
for
an
excuse
to
put
his
hand
anear
me
drawers
drawers
the
whole
blessed
time
till
i
promised
to
give
him
the
pair
off
my
doll
to
carry
about
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
o
maria
santisima
he
did
look
a
big
fool
dreeping
in
the
rain
splendid
set
of
teeth
he
had
made
me
hungry
to
look
at
them
and
beseeched
of
me
to
lift
the
orange
petticoat
i
had
on
with
the
sunray
pleats
that
there
was
nobody
he
said
hed
kneel
down
in
the
wet
if
i
didnt
so
persevering
he
would
too
and
ruin
his
new
raincoat
you
never
know
what
freak
theyd
take
alone
with
you
theyre
so
savage
for
it
if
anyone
was
passing
so
i
lifted
them
a
bit
and
touched
his
trousers
outside
the
way
i
used
to
gardner
after
with
my
ring
hand
to
keep
him
from
doing
worse
where
it
was
too
public
i
was
dying
to
find
out
was
he
circumcised
he
was
shaking
like
a
jelly
all
over
they
want
to
do
everything
too
quick
take
all
the
pleasure
out
of
it
and
father
waiting
all
the
time
for
his
dinner
he
told
me
to
say
i
left
my
purse
in
the
butchers
and
had
to
go
back
for
it
what
a
deceiver
then
he
wrote
me
that
letter
with
all
those
words
in
it
how
could
he
have
the
face
to
any
woman
after
his
company
manners
making
it
so
awkward
after
when
we
met
asking
me
have
i
offended
you
with
my
eyelids
down
of
course
he
saw
i
wasnt
he
had
a
few
brains
not
like
that
other
fool
henny
doyle
he
was
always
breaking
or
tearing
something
in
the
charades
i
hate
an
unlucky
man
and
if
i
knew
what
it
meant
of
course
i
had
to
say
no
for
form
sake
dont
understand
you
i
said
and
wasnt
it
natural
so
it
is
of
course
it
used
to
be
written
up
with
a
picture
of
a
womans
on
that
wall
in
gibraltar
with
that
word
i
couldnt
find
anywhere
only
for
children
seeing
it
too
young
then
writing
every
morning
a
letter
sometimes
twice
a
day
i
liked
the
way
he
made
love
then
he
knew
the
way
to
take
a
woman
when
he
sent
me
the
big
poppies
because
mine
was
the
then
i
wrote
the
night
he
kissed
my
heart
at
dolphins
barn
i
couldnt
describe
it
simply
it
makes
you
feel
like
nothing
on
earth
but
he
never
knew
how
to
embrace
well
like
gardner
i
hope
hell
come
on
monday
as
he
said
at
the
same
time
four
i
hate
people
who
come
at
all
hours
answer
the
door
you
think
its
the
vegetables
then
its
somebody
and
you
all
undressed
or
the
door
of
the
filthy
sloppy
kitchen
blows
open
the
day
old
frostyface
goodwin
called
about
the
concert
in
lombard
street
and
i
just
after
dinner
all
flushed
and
tossed
with
boiling
old
stew
dont
look
at
me
professor
i
had
to
say
im
a
fright
yes
but
he
was
a
real
old
gent
in
his
way
it
was
impossible
to
be
more
respectful
nobody
to
say
youre
out
you
have
to
peep
out
through
the
blind
like
the
messengerboy
today
i
thought
it
was
a
putoff
first
him
sending
the
port
and
the
peaches
first
and
i
was
just
beginning
to
yawn
with
nerves
thinking
he
was
trying
to
make
a
fool
of
me
when
i
knew
his
tattarrattat
at
the
door
he
must
have
been
a
bit
late
because
it
was
after
when
i
saw
the
dedalus
girls
coming
from
school
i
never
know
the
time
even
that
watch
he
gave
me
never
seems
to
go
properly
id
want
to
get
it
looked
after
when
i
threw
the
penny
to
that
lame
sailor
for
england
home
and
beauty
when
i
was
whistling
there
is
a
charming
girl
i
love
and
i
hadnt
even
put
on
my
clean
shift
or
powdered
myself
or
a
thing
then
this
day
week
were
to
go
to
belfast
just
as
well
he
has
to
go
to
ennis
his
fathers
anniversary
the
it
wouldnt
be
pleasant
if
he
did
suppose
our
rooms
at
the
hotel
were
beside
each
other
and
any
fooling
went
on
in
the
new
bed
i
couldnt
tell
him
to
stop
and
not
bother
me
with
him
in
the
next
room
or
perhaps
some
protestant
clergyman
with
a
cough
knocking
on
the
wall
then
hed
never
believe
the
next
day
we
didnt
do
something
its
all
very
well
a
husband
but
you
cant
fool
a
lover
after
me
telling
him
we
never
did
anything
of
course
he
didnt
believe
me
no
its
better
hes
going
where
he
is
besides
something
always
happens
with
him
the
time
going
to
the
mallow
concert
at
maryborough
ordering
boiling
soup
for
the
two
of
us
then
the
bell
rang
out
he
walks
down
the
platform
with
the
soup
splashing
about
taking
spoonfuls
of
it
hadnt
he
the
nerve
and
the
waiter
after
him
making
a
holy
show
of
us
screeching
and
confusion
for
the
engine
to
start
but
he
wouldnt
pay
till
he
finished
it
the
two
gentlemen
in
the
class
carriage
said
he
was
quite
right
so
he
was
too
hes
so
pigheaded
sometimes
when
he
gets
a
thing
into
his
head
a
good
job
he
was
able
to
open
the
carriage
door
with
his
knife
or
theyd
have
taken
us
on
to
cork
i
suppose
that
was
done
out
of
revenge
on
him
o
i
love
jaunting
in
a
train
or
a
car
with
lovely
soft
cushions
i
wonder
will
he
take
a
class
for
me
he
might
want
to
do
it
in
the
train
by
tipping
the
guard
well
o
i
suppose
therell
be
the
usual
idiots
of
men
gaping
at
us
with
their
eyes
as
stupid
as
ever
they
can
possibly
be
that
was
an
exceptional
man
that
common
workman
that
left
us
alone
in
the
carriage
that
day
going
to
howth
id
like
to
find
out
something
about
him
or
tunnels
perhaps
then
you
have
to
look
out
of
the
window
all
the
nicer
then
coming
back
suppose
i
never
came
back
what
would
they
say
eloped
with
him
that
gets
you
on
on
the
stage
the
last
concert
i
sang
at
where
its
over
a
year
ago
when
was
it
st
teresas
hall
clarendon
st
little
chits
of
missies
they
have
now
singing
kathleen
kearney
and
her
like
on
account
of
father
being
in
the
army
and
my
singing
the
absentminded
beggar
and
wearing
a
brooch
for
lord
roberts
when
i
had
the
map
of
it
all
and
poldy
not
irish
enough
was
it
him
managed
it
this
time
i
wouldnt
put
it
past
him
like
he
got
me
on
to
sing
in
the
stabat
mater
by
going
around
saying
he
was
putting
lead
kindly
light
to
music
i
put
him
up
to
that
till
the
jesuits
found
out
he
was
a
freemason
thumping
the
piano
lead
thou
me
on
copied
from
some
old
opera
yes
and
he
was
going
about
with
some
of
them
sinner
fein
lately
or
whatever
they
call
themselves
talking
his
usual
trash
and
nonsense
he
says
that
little
man
he
showed
me
without
the
neck
is
very
intelligent
the
coming
man
griffiths
is
he
well
he
doesnt
look
it
thats
all
i
can
say
still
it
must
have
been
him
he
knew
there
was
a
boycott
i
hate
the
mention
of
their
politics
after
the
war
that
pretoria
and
ladysmith
and
bloemfontein
where
gardner
lieut
stanley
g
bn
east
lancs
rgt
of
enteric
fever
he
was
a
lovely
fellow
in
khaki
and
just
the
right
height
over
me
im
sure
he
was
brave
too
he
said
i
was
lovely
the
evening
we
kissed
goodbye
at
the
canal
lock
my
irish
beauty
he
was
pale
with
excitement
about
going
away
or
wed
be
seen
from
the
road
he
couldnt
stand
properly
and
i
so
hot
as
i
never
felt
they
could
have
made
their
peace
in
the
beginning
or
old
oom
paul
and
the
rest
of
the
other
old
krugers
go
and
fight
it
out
between
them
instead
of
dragging
on
for
years
killing
any
finelooking
men
there
were
with
their
fever
if
he
was
even
decently
shot
it
wouldnt
have
been
so
bad
i
love
to
see
a
regiment
pass
in
review
the
first
time
i
saw
the
spanish
cavalry
at
la
roque
it
was
lovely
after
looking
across
the
bay
from
algeciras
all
the
lights
of
the
rock
like
fireflies
or
those
sham
battles
on
the
acres
the
black
watch
with
their
kilts
in
time
at
the
march
past
the
hussars
the
prince
of
wales
own
or
the
lancers
o
the
lancers
theyre
grand
or
the
dublins
that
won
tugela
his
father
made
his
money
over
selling
the
horses
for
the
cavalry
well
he
could
buy
me
a
nice
present
up
in
belfast
after
what
i
gave
him
theyve
lovely
linen
up
there
or
one
of
those
nice
kimono
things
i
must
buy
a
mothball
like
i
had
before
to
keep
in
the
drawer
with
them
it
would
be
exciting
going
round
with
him
shopping
buying
those
things
in
a
new
city
better
leave
this
ring
behind
want
to
keep
turning
and
turning
to
get
it
over
the
knuckle
there
or
they
might
bell
it
round
the
town
in
their
papers
or
tell
the
police
on
me
but
theyd
think
were
married
o
let
them
all
go
and
smother
themselves
for
the
fat
lot
i
care
he
has
plenty
of
money
and
hes
not
a
marrying
man
so
somebody
better
get
it
out
of
him
if
i
could
find
out
whether
he
likes
me
i
looked
a
bit
washy
of
course
when
i
looked
close
in
the
handglass
powdering
a
mirror
never
gives
you
the
expression
besides
scrooching
down
on
me
like
that
all
the
time
with
his
big
hipbones
hes
heavy
too
with
his
hairy
chest
for
this
heat
always
having
to
lie
down
for
them
better
for
him
put
it
into
me
from
behind
the
way
mrs
mastiansky
told
me
her
husband
made
her
like
the
dogs
do
it
and
stick
out
her
tongue
as
far
as
ever
she
could
and
he
so
quiet
and
mild
with
his
tingating
cither
can
you
ever
be
up
to
men
the
way
it
takes
them
lovely
stuff
in
that
blue
suit
he
had
on
and
stylish
tie
and
socks
with
the
skyblue
silk
things
on
them
hes
certainly
welloff
i
know
by
the
cut
his
clothes
have
and
his
heavy
watch
but
he
was
like
a
perfect
devil
for
a
few
minutes
after
he
came
back
with
the
stoppress
tearing
up
the
tickets
and
swearing
blazes
because
he
lost
quid
he
said
he
lost
over
that
outsider
that
won
and
half
he
put
on
for
me
on
account
of
lenehans
tip
cursing
him
to
the
lowest
pits
that
sponger
he
was
making
free
with
me
after
the
glencree
dinner
coming
back
that
long
joult
over
the
featherbed
mountain
after
the
lord
mayor
looking
at
me
with
his
dirty
eyes
val
dillon
that
big
heathen
i
first
noticed
him
at
dessert
when
i
was
cracking
the
nuts
with
my
teeth
i
wished
i
could
have
picked
every
morsel
of
that
chicken
out
of
my
fingers
it
was
so
tasty
and
browned
and
as
tender
as
anything
only
for
i
didnt
want
to
eat
everything
on
my
plate
those
forks
and
fishslicers
were
hallmarked
silver
too
i
wish
i
had
some
i
could
easily
have
slipped
a
couple
into
my
muff
when
i
was
playing
with
them
then
always
hanging
out
of
them
for
money
in
a
restaurant
for
the
bit
you
put
down
your
throat
we
have
to
be
thankful
for
our
mangy
cup
of
tea
itself
as
a
great
compliment
to
be
noticed
the
way
the
world
is
divided
in
any
case
if
its
going
to
go
on
i
want
at
least
two
other
good
chemises
for
one
thing
and
but
i
dont
know
what
kind
of
drawers
he
likes
none
at
all
i
think
didnt
he
say
yes
and
half
the
girls
in
gibraltar
never
wore
them
either
naked
as
god
made
them
that
andalusian
singing
her
manola
she
didnt
make
much
secret
of
what
she
hadnt
yes
and
the
second
pair
of
silkette
stockings
is
laddered
after
one
days
wear
i
could
have
brought
them
back
to
lewers
this
morning
and
kicked
up
a
row
and
made
that
one
change
them
only
not
to
upset
myself
and
run
the
risk
of
walking
into
him
and
ruining
the
whole
thing
and
one
of
those
kidfitting
corsets
id
want
advertised
cheap
in
the
gentlewoman
with
elastic
gores
on
the
hips
he
saved
the
one
i
have
but
thats
no
good
what
did
they
say
they
give
a
delightful
figure
line
obviating
that
unsightly
broad
appearance
across
the
lower
back
to
reduce
flesh
my
belly
is
a
bit
too
big
ill
have
to
knock
off
the
stout
at
dinner
or
am
i
getting
too
fond
of
it
the
last
they
sent
from
orourkes
was
as
flat
as
a
pancake
he
makes
his
money
easy
larry
they
call
him
the
old
mangy
parcel
he
sent
at
xmas
a
cottage
cake
and
a
bottle
of
hogwash
he
tried
to
palm
off
as
claret
that
he
couldnt
get
anyone
to
drink
god
spare
his
spit
for
fear
hed
die
of
the
drouth
or
i
must
do
a
few
breathing
exercises
i
wonder
is
that
antifat
any
good
might
overdo
it
the
thin
ones
are
not
so
much
the
fashion
now
garters
that
much
i
have
the
violet
pair
i
wore
today
thats
all
he
bought
me
out
of
the
cheque
he
got
on
the
first
o
no
there
was
the
face
lotion
i
finished
the
last
of
yesterday
that
made
my
skin
like
new
i
told
him
over
and
over
again
get
that
made
up
in
the
same
place
and
dont
forget
it
god
only
knows
whether
he
did
after
all
i
said
to
him
ill
know
by
the
bottle
anyway
if
not
i
suppose
ill
only
have
to
wash
in
my
piss
like
beeftea
or
chickensoup
with
some
of
that
opoponax
and
violet
i
thought
it
was
beginning
to
look
coarse
or
old
a
bit
the
skin
underneath
is
much
finer
where
it
peeled
off
there
on
my
finger
after
the
burn
its
a
pity
it
isnt
all
like
that
and
the
four
paltry
handkerchiefs
about
in
all
sure
you
cant
get
on
in
this
world
without
style
all
going
in
food
and
rent
when
i
get
it
ill
lash
it
around
i
tell
you
in
fine
style
i
always
want
to
throw
a
handful
of
tea
into
the
pot
measuring
and
mincing
if
i
buy
a
pair
of
old
brogues
itself
do
you
like
those
new
shoes
yes
were
they
ive
no
clothes
at
all
the
brown
costume
and
the
skirt
and
jacket
and
the
one
at
the
cleaners
whats
that
for
any
woman
cutting
up
this
old
hat
and
patching
up
the
other
the
men
wont
look
at
you
and
women
try
to
walk
on
you
because
they
know
youve
no
man
then
with
all
the
things
getting
dearer
every
day
for
the
years
more
i
have
of
life
up
to
no
im
what
am
i
at
all
ill
be
in
september
will
i
what
o
well
look
at
that
mrs
galbraith
shes
much
older
than
me
i
saw
her
when
i
was
out
last
week
her
beautys
on
the
wane
she
was
a
lovely
woman
magnificent
head
of
hair
on
her
down
to
her
waist
tossing
it
back
like
that
like
kitty
oshea
in
grantham
street
thing
i
did
every
morning
to
look
across
see
her
combing
it
as
if
she
loved
it
and
was
full
of
it
pity
i
only
got
to
know
her
the
day
before
we
left
and
that
mrs
langtry
the
jersey
lily
the
prince
of
wales
was
in
love
with
i
suppose
hes
like
the
first
man
going
the
roads
only
for
the
name
of
a
king
theyre
all
made
the
one
way
only
a
black
mans
id
like
to
try
a
beauty
up
to
what
was
she
there
was
some
funny
story
about
the
jealous
old
husband
what
was
it
at
all
and
an
oyster
knife
he
went
no
he
made
her
wear
a
kind
of
a
tin
thing
round
her
and
the
prince
of
wales
yes
he
had
the
oyster
knife
cant
be
true
a
thing
like
that
like
some
of
those
books
he
brings
me
the
works
of
master
francois
somebody
supposed
to
be
a
priest
about
a
child
born
out
of
her
ear
because
her
bumgut
fell
out
a
nice
word
for
any
priest
to
write
and
her
as
if
any
fool
wouldnt
know
what
that
meant
i
hate
that
pretending
of
all
things
with
that
old
blackguards
face
on
him
anybody
can
see
its
not
true
and
that
ruby
and
fair
tyrants
he
brought
me
that
twice
i
remember
when
i
came
to
page
the
part
about
where
she
hangs
him
up
out
of
a
hook
with
a
cord
flagellate
sure
theres
nothing
for
a
woman
in
that
all
invention
made
up
about
he
drinking
the
champagne
out
of
her
slipper
after
the
ball
was
over
like
the
infant
jesus
in
the
crib
at
inchicore
in
the
blessed
virgins
arms
sure
no
woman
could
have
a
child
that
big
taken
out
of
her
and
i
thought
first
it
came
out
of
her
side
because
how
could
she
go
to
the
chamber
when
she
wanted
to
and
she
a
rich
lady
of
course
she
felt
honoured
h
r
h
he
was
in
gibraltar
the
year
i
was
born
i
bet
he
found
lilies
there
too
where
he
planted
the
tree
he
planted
more
than
that
in
his
time
he
might
have
planted
me
too
if
hed
come
a
bit
sooner
then
i
wouldnt
be
here
as
i
am
he
ought
to
chuck
that
freeman
with
the
paltry
few
shillings
he
knocks
out
of
it
and
go
into
an
office
or
something
where
hed
get
regular
pay
or
a
bank
where
they
could
put
him
up
on
a
throne
to
count
the
money
all
the
day
of
course
he
prefers
plottering
about
the
house
so
you
cant
stir
with
him
any
side
whats
your
programme
today
i
wish
hed
even
smoke
a
pipe
like
father
to
get
the
smell
of
a
man
or
pretending
to
be
mooching
about
for
advertisements
when
he
could
have
been
in
mr
cuffes
still
only
for
what
he
did
then
sending
me
to
try
and
patch
it
up
i
could
have
got
him
promoted
there
to
be
the
manager
he
gave
me
a
great
mirada
once
or
twice
first
he
was
as
stiff
as
the
mischief
really
and
truly
mrs
bloom
only
i
felt
rotten
simply
with
the
old
rubbishy
dress
that
i
lost
the
leads
out
of
the
tails
with
no
cut
in
it
but
theyre
coming
into
fashion
again
i
bought
it
simply
to
please
him
i
knew
it
was
no
good
by
the
finish
pity
i
changed
my
mind
of
going
to
todd
and
burns
as
i
said
and
not
lees
it
was
just
like
the
shop
itself
rummage
sale
a
lot
of
trash
i
hate
those
rich
shops
get
on
your
nerves
nothing
kills
me
altogether
only
he
thinks
he
knows
a
great
lot
about
a
womans
dress
and
cooking
mathering
everything
he
can
scour
off
the
shelves
into
it
if
i
went
by
his
advices
every
blessed
hat
i
put
on
does
that
suit
me
yes
take
that
thats
alright
the
one
like
a
weddingcake
standing
up
miles
off
my
head
he
said
suited
me
or
the
dishcover
one
coming
down
on
my
backside
on
pins
and
needles
about
the
shopgirl
in
that
place
in
grafton
street
i
had
the
misfortune
to
bring
him
into
and
she
as
insolent
as
ever
she
could
be
with
her
smirk
saying
im
afraid
were
giving
you
too
much
trouble
what
shes
there
for
but
i
stared
it
out
of
her
yes
he
was
awfully
stiff
and
no
wonder
but
he
changed
the
second
time
he
looked
poldy
pigheaded
as
usual
like
the
soup
but
i
could
see
him
looking
very
hard
at
my
chest
when
he
stood
up
to
open
the
door
for
me
it
was
nice
of
him
to
show
me
out
in
any
case
im
extremely
sorry
mrs
bloom
believe
me
without
making
it
too
marked
the
first
time
after
him
being
insulted
and
me
being
supposed
to
be
his
wife
i
just
half
smiled
i
know
my
chest
was
out
that
way
at
the
door
when
he
said
im
extremely
sorry
and
im
sure
you
were
yes
i
think
he
made
them
a
bit
firmer
sucking
them
like
that
so
long
he
made
me
thirsty
titties
he
calls
them
i
had
to
laugh
yes
this
one
anyhow
stiff
the
nipple
gets
for
the
least
thing
ill
get
him
to
keep
that
up
and
ill
take
those
eggs
beaten
up
with
marsala
fatten
them
out
for
him
what
are
all
those
veins
and
things
curious
the
way
its
made
the
same
in
case
of
twins
theyre
supposed
to
represent
beauty
placed
up
there
like
those
statues
in
the
museum
one
of
them
pretending
to
hide
it
with
her
hand
are
they
so
beautiful
of
course
compared
with
what
a
man
looks
like
with
his
two
bags
full
and
his
other
thing
hanging
down
out
of
him
or
sticking
up
at
you
like
a
hatrack
no
wonder
they
hide
it
with
a
cabbageleaf
that
disgusting
cameron
highlander
behind
the
meat
market
or
that
other
wretch
with
the
red
head
behind
the
tree
where
the
statue
of
the
fish
used
to
be
when
i
was
passing
pretending
he
was
pissing
standing
out
for
me
to
see
it
with
his
babyclothes
up
to
one
side
the
queens
own
they
were
a
nice
lot
its
well
the
surreys
relieved
them
theyre
always
trying
to
show
it
to
you
every
time
nearly
i
passed
outside
the
mens
greenhouse
near
the
harcourt
street
station
just
to
try
some
fellow
or
other
trying
to
catch
my
eye
as
if
it
was
of
the
wonders
of
the
world
o
and
the
stink
of
those
rotten
places
the
night
coming
home
with
poldy
after
the
comerfords
party
oranges
and
lemonade
to
make
you
feel
nice
and
watery
i
went
into
of
them
it
was
so
biting
cold
i
couldnt
keep
it
when
was
that
the
canal
was
frozen
yes
it
was
a
few
months
after
a
pity
a
couple
of
the
camerons
werent
there
to
see
me
squatting
in
the
mens
place
meadero
i
tried
to
draw
a
picture
of
it
before
i
tore
it
up
like
a
sausage
or
something
i
wonder
theyre
not
afraid
going
about
of
getting
a
kick
or
a
bang
of
something
there
the
woman
is
beauty
of
course
thats
admitted
when
he
said
i
could
pose
for
a
picture
naked
to
some
rich
fellow
in
holles
street
when
he
lost
the
job
in
helys
and
i
was
selling
the
clothes
and
strumming
in
the
coffee
palace
would
i
be
like
that
bath
of
the
nymph
with
my
hair
down
yes
only
shes
younger
or
im
a
little
like
that
dirty
bitch
in
that
spanish
photo
he
has
nymphs
used
they
go
about
like
that
i
asked
him
about
her
and
that
word
met
something
with
hoses
in
it
and
he
came
out
with
some
jawbreakers
about
the
incarnation
he
never
can
explain
a
thing
simply
the
way
a
body
can
understand
then
he
goes
and
burns
the
bottom
out
of
the
pan
all
for
his
kidney
this
one
not
so
much
theres
the
mark
of
his
teeth
still
where
he
tried
to
bite
the
nipple
i
had
to
scream
out
arent
they
fearful
trying
to
hurt
you
i
had
a
great
breast
of
milk
with
milly
enough
for
two
what
was
the
reason
of
that
he
said
i
could
have
got
a
pound
a
week
as
a
wet
nurse
all
swelled
out
the
morning
that
delicate
looking
student
that
stopped
in
no
with
the
citrons
penrose
nearly
caught
me
washing
through
the
window
only
for
i
snapped
up
the
towel
to
my
face
that
was
his
studenting
hurt
me
they
used
to
weaning
her
till
he
got
doctor
brady
to
give
me
the
belladonna
prescription
i
had
to
get
him
to
suck
them
they
were
so
hard
he
said
it
was
sweeter
and
thicker
than
cows
then
he
wanted
to
milk
me
into
the
tea
well
hes
beyond
everything
i
declare
somebody
ought
to
put
him
in
the
budget
if
i
only
could
remember
the
one
half
of
the
things
and
write
a
book
out
of
it
the
works
of
master
poldy
yes
and
its
so
much
smoother
the
skin
much
an
hour
he
was
at
them
im
sure
by
the
clock
like
some
kind
of
a
big
infant
i
had
at
me
they
want
everything
in
their
mouth
all
the
pleasure
those
men
get
out
of
a
woman
i
can
feel
his
mouth
o
lord
i
must
stretch
myself
i
wished
he
was
here
or
somebody
to
let
myself
go
with
and
come
again
like
that
i
feel
all
fire
inside
me
or
if
i
could
dream
it
when
he
made
me
spend
the
time
tickling
me
behind
with
his
finger
i
was
coming
for
about
minutes
with
my
legs
round
him
i
had
to
hug
him
after
o
lord
i
wanted
to
shout
out
all
sorts
of
things
fuck
or
shit
or
anything
at
all
only
not
to
look
ugly
or
those
lines
from
the
strain
who
knows
the
way
hed
take
it
you
want
to
feel
your
way
with
a
man
theyre
not
all
like
him
thank
god
some
of
them
want
you
to
be
so
nice
about
it
i
noticed
the
contrast
he
does
it
and
doesnt
talk
i
gave
my
eyes
that
look
with
my
hair
a
bit
loose
from
the
tumbling
and
my
tongue
between
my
lips
up
to
him
the
savage
brute

out
of
them
all
sides

the
poor
men

wives

roasting
engines
stifling
it

old
freemans

careless

him
asking
wheres
last
januarys
paper

all
those
old
overcoats

bundled
out
of
the
hall
making
the
place
hotter
than
it
is
that
rain
was
lovely
and
refreshing
just
after
my
beauty
sleep
i
thought
it
was
going
to
get
like
gibraltar
my
goodness
the
heat
there
before
the
levanter
came
on
black
as
night
and
the
glare
of
the
rock
standing
up
in
it
like
a
big
giant
compared
with
their
rock
mountain
they
think
is
so
great
with
the
red
sentries
here
and
there
the
poplars
and
they
all
whitehot
and
the
smell
of
the
rainwater
in
those
tanks
watching
the
sun
all
the
time
weltering
down
on
you
faded
all
that
lovely
frock
fathers
friend
mrs
stanhope

me
from
the
b
marche
paris
what
a
shame
my
dearest
doggerina

just
a
p
c

jolly
warm
bath

called
him
wogger
wd
give
anything
to
be
back
in
gib
and
hear
you
sing
waiting
and
in
old
madrid
concone
is
the
name
of
those
exercises
he
bought
me
one
of
those
new
some
word
i
couldnt
make
out
shawls
amusing
things
but
tear
for
the
least
thing
still
there
lovely
i

dont
you

always
think
of
the
lovely
teas
we

scrumptious
currant
scones
and
raspberry
wafers

now
dearest
doggerina
be

kind
she
left
out
regards
to
your
father
also
captain
grove
with
love
yrs
affly
hester
x
x
x
x
x
she
didnt
look
a
bit
married
just
like
a
girl
he
was
years
older
than
her
wogger
he
was
awfully
fond
of
me
when
he
held
down
the
wire
with
his
foot
for
me
to
step
over
at
the
bullfight
at
la
linea
when
that
matador
gomez
was
given
the
bulls
ear
these
clothes
we
have
to
wear
whoever
invented
them
expecting
you
to
walk
up
killiney
hill
then
for
example
at
that
picnic
all
staysed
up
you
cant
do
a
blessed
thing
in
them
in
a
crowd
run
or
jump
out
of
the
way
thats
why
i
was
afraid
when
that
other
ferocious
old
bull
began
to
charge
the
banderilleros
with
the
sashes
and
the
things
in
their
hats
and
the
brutes
of
men
shouting
bravo
toro
sure
the
women
were
as
bad
in
their
nice
white
mantillas
ripping
all
the
whole
insides
out
of
those
poor
horses
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
in
all
my
life
yes
he
used
to
break
his
heart
at
me
taking
off
the
dog
barking
in
bell
lane
poor
brute
and
it
sick
what
became
of
them
ever
i
suppose
theyre
dead
long
ago
the
of
them
its
like
all
through
a
mist
makes
you
feel
so
old
i
made
the
scones
of
course
i
had
everything
all
to
myself
then
a
girl
hester
we
used
to
compare
our
hair
mine
was
thicker
than
hers
she
showed
me
how
to
settle
it
at
the
back
when
i
put
it
up
and
whats
this
else
how
to
make
a
knot
on
a
thread
with
the
one
hand
we
were
like
cousins
what
age
was
i
then
the
night
of
the
storm
i
slept
in
her
bed
she
had
her
arms
round
me
then
we
were
fighting
in
the
morning
with
the
pillow
what
fun
he
was
watching
me
whenever
he
got
an
opportunity
at
the
band
on
the
alameda
esplanade
when
i
was
with
father
and
captain
grove
i
looked
up
at
the
church
first
and
then
at
the
windows
then
down
and
our
eyes
met
i
felt
something
go
through
me
like
all
needles
my
eyes
were
dancing
i
remember
after
when
i
looked
at
myself
in
the
glass
hardly
recognised
myself
the
change
he
was
attractive
to
a
girl
in
spite
of
his
being
a
little
bald
intelligent
looking
disappointed
and
gay
at
the
same
time
he
was
like
thomas
in
the
shadow
of
ashlydyat
i
had
a
splendid
skin
from
the
sun
and
the
excitement
like
a
rose
i
didnt
get
a
wink
of
sleep
it
wouldnt
have
been
nice
on
account
of
her
but
i
could
have
stopped
it
in
time
she
gave
me
the
moonstone
to
read
that
was
the
first
i
read
of
wilkie
collins
east
lynne
i
read
and
the
shadow
of
ashlydyat
mrs
henry
wood
henry
dunbar
by
that
other
woman
i
lent
him
afterwards
with
mulveys
photo
in
it
so
as
he
see
i
wasnt
without
and
lord
lytton
eugene
aram
molly
bawn
she
gave
me
by
mrs
hungerford
on
account
of
the
name
i
dont
like
books
with
a
molly
in
them
like
that
one
he
brought
me
about
the
one
from
flanders
a
whore
always
shoplifting
anything
she
could
cloth
and
stuff
and
yards
of
it
o
this
blanket
is
too
heavy
on
me
thats
better
i
havent
even
one
decent
nightdress
this
thing
gets
all
rolled
under
me
besides
him
and
his
fooling
thats
better
i
used
to
be
weltering
then
in
the
heat
my
shift
drenched
with
the
sweat
stuck
in
the
cheeks
of
my
bottom
on
the
chair
when
i
stood
up
they
were
so
fattish
and
firm
when
i
got
up
on
the
sofa
cushions
to
see
with
my
clothes
up
and
the
bugs
tons
of
them
at
night
and
the
mosquito
nets
i
couldnt
read
a
line
lord
how
long
ago
it
seems
centuries
of
course
they
never
came
back
and
she
didnt
put
her
address
right
on
it
either
she
may
have
noticed
her
wogger
people
were
always
going
away
and
we
never
i
remember
that
day
with
the
waves
and
the
boats
with
their
high
heads
rocking
and
the
smell
of
ship
those
officers
uniforms
on
shore
leave
made
me
seasick
he
didnt
say
anything
he
was
very
serious
i
had
the
high
buttoned
boots
on
and
my
skirt
was
blowing
she
kissed
me
six
or
seven
times
didnt
i
cry
yes
i
believe
i
did
or
near
it
my
lips
were
taittering
when
i
said
goodbye
she
had
a
gorgeous
wrap
of
some
special
kind
of
blue
colour
on
her
for
the
voyage
made
very
peculiarly
to
one
side
like
and
it
was
extremely
pretty
it
got
as
dull
as
the
devil
after
they
went
i
was
almost
planning
to
run
away
mad
out
of
it
somewhere
were
never
easy
where
we
are
father
or
aunt
or
marriage
waiting
always
waiting
to
guiiiide
him
toooo
me
waiting
nor
speeeed
his
flying
feet
their
damn
guns
bursting
and
booming
all
over
the
shop
especially
the
queens
birthday
and
throwing
everything
down
in
all
directions
if
you
didnt
open
the
windows
when
general
ulysses
grant
whoever
he
was
or
did
supposed
to
be
some
great
fellow
landed
off
the
ship
and
old
sprague
the
consul
that
was
there
from
before
the
flood
dressed
up
poor
man
and
he
in
mourning
for
the
son
then
the
same
old
bugles
for
reveille
in
the
morning
and
drums
rolling
and
the
unfortunate
poor
devils
of
soldiers
walking
about
with
messtins
smelling
the
place
more
than
the
old
longbearded
jews
in
their
jellibees
and
levites
assembly
and
sound
clear
and
gunfire
for
the
men
to
cross
the
lines
and
the
warden
marching
with
his
keys
to
lock
the
gates
and
the
bagpipes
and
only
captain
groves
and
father
talking
about
rorkes
drift
and
plevna
and
sir
garnet
wolseley
and
gordon
at
khartoum
lighting
their
pipes
for
them
everytime
they
went
out
drunken
old
devil
with
his
grog
on
the
windowsill
catch
him
leaving
any
of
it
picking
his
nose
trying
to
think
of
some
other
dirty
story
to
tell
up
in
a
corner
but
he
never
forgot
himself
when
i
was
there
sending
me
out
of
the
room
on
some
blind
excuse
paying
his
compliments
the
bushmills
whisky
talking
of
course
but
hed
do
the
same
to
the
next
woman
that
came
along
i
suppose
he
died
of
galloping
drink
ages
ago
the
days
like
years
not
a
letter
from
a
living
soul
except
the
odd
few
i
posted
to
myself
with
bits
of
paper
in
them
so
bored
sometimes
i
could
fight
with
my
nails
listening
to
that
old
arab
with
the
one
eye
and
his
heass
of
an
instrument
singing
his
heah
heah
aheah
all
my
compriments
on
your
hotchapotch
of
your
heass
as
bad
as
now
with
the
hands
hanging
off
me
looking
out
of
the
window
if
there
was
a
nice
fellow
even
in
the
opposite
house
that
medical
in
holles
street
the
nurse
was
after
when
i
put
on
my
gloves
and
hat
at
the
window
to
show
i
was
going
out
not
a
notion
what
i
meant
arent
they
thick
never
understand
what
you
say
even
youd
want
to
print
it
up
on
a
big
poster
for
them
not
even
if
you
shake
hands
twice
with
the
left
he
didnt
recognise
me
either
when
i
half
frowned
at
him
outside
westland
row
chapel
where
does
their
great
intelligence
come
in
id
like
to
know
grey
matter
they
have
it
all
in
their
tail
if
you
ask
me
those
country
gougers
up
in
the
city
arms
intelligence
they
had
a
damn
sight
less
than
the
bulls
and
cows
they
were
selling
the
meat
and
the
coalmans
bell
that
noisy
bugger
trying
to
swindle
me
with
the

moment
and

new
world
i
could
write
the
answer
in
bed
to
let
him
imagine
me
short
just
a
few
words
not
those
long
crossed
letters
atty
dillon
used
to
write
to
the
fellow
that
was
something
in
the
four
courts
that
jilted
her
after
out
of
the
ladies
letterwriter
when
i
told
her
to
say
a
few
simple
words
he
could
twist
how
he
liked
not
acting
with
precipat
precipitancy
with
equal
candour
the
greatest
earthly
happiness
answer
to
a
gentlemans
proposal
affirmatively
my
goodness
theres
nothing
else
its
all
very
fine
for
them
but
as
for
being
a
woman
as
soon
as
youre
old
they
might
as
well
throw
you
out
in
the
bottom
of
the
ashpit
mulveys
was
the
first
when
i
was
in
bed
that
morning
and
mrs
rubio
brought
it
in
with
the
coffee
she
stood
there
standing
when
i
asked
her
to
hand
me
and
i
pointing
at
them
i
couldnt
think
of
the
word
a
hairpin
to
open
it
with
ah
horquilla
disobliging
old
thing
and
it
staring
her
in
the
face
with
her
switch
of
false
hair
on
her
and
vain
about
her
appearance
ugly
as
she
was
near
or
a
her
face
a
mass
of
wrinkles
with
all
her
religion
domineering
because
she
never
could
get
over
the
atlantic
fleet
coming
in
half
the
ships
of
the
world
and
the
union
jack
flying
with
all
her
carabineros
because
drunken
english
sailors
took
all
the
rock
from
them
and
because
i
didnt
run
into
mass
often
enough
in
santa
maria
to
please
her
with
her
shawl
up
on
her
except
when
there
was
a
marriage
on
with
all
her
miracles
of
the
saints
and
her
black
blessed
virgin
with
the
silver
dress
and
the
sun
dancing
times
on
easter
sunday
morning
and
when
the
priest
was
going
by
with
the
bell
bringing
the
vatican
to
the
dying
blessing
herself
for
his
majestad
an
admirer
he
signed
it
i
near
jumped
out
of
my
skin
i
wanted
to
pick
him
up
when
i
saw
him
following
me
along
the
calle
real
in
the
shop
window
then
he
tipped
me
just
in
passing
but
i
never
thought
hed
write
making
an
appointment
i
had
it
inside
my
petticoat
bodice
all
day
reading
it
up
in
every
hole
and
corner
while
father
was
up
at
the
drill
instructing
to
find
out
by
the
handwriting
or
the
language
of
stamps
singing
i
remember
shall
i
wear
a
white
rose
and
i
wanted
to
put
on
the
old
stupid
clock
to
near
the
time
he
was
the
first
man
kissed
me
under
the
moorish
wall
my
sweetheart
when
a
boy
it
never
entered
my
head
what
kissing
meant
till
he
put
his
tongue
in
my
mouth
his
mouth
was
sweetlike
young
i
put
my
knee
up
to
him
a
few
times
to
learn
the
way
what
did
i
tell
him
i
was
engaged
for
for
fun
to
the
son
of
a
spanish
nobleman
named
don
miguel
de
la
flora
and
he
believed
me
that
i
was
to
be
married
to
him
in
years
time
theres
many
a
true
word
spoken
in
jest
there
is
a
flower
that
bloometh
a
few
things
i
told
him
true
about
myself
just
for
him
to
be
imagining
the
spanish
girls
he
didnt
like
i
suppose
one
of
them
wouldnt
have
him
i
got
him
excited
he
crushed
all
the
flowers
on
my
bosom
he
brought
me
he
couldnt
count
the
pesetas
and
the
perragordas
till
i
taught
him
cappoquin
he
came
from
he
said
on
the
black
water
but
it
was
too
short
then
the
day
before
he
left
may
yes
it
was
may
when
the
infant
king
of
spain
was
born
im
always
like
that
in
the
spring
id
like
a
new
fellow
every
year
up
on
the
tiptop
under
the
rockgun
near
oharas
tower
i
told
him
it
was
struck
by
lightning
and
all
about
the
old
barbary
apes
they
sent
to
clapham
without
a
tail
careering
all
over
the
show
on
each
others
back
mrs
rubio
said
she
was
a
regular
old
rock
scorpion
robbing
the
chickens
out
of
inces
farm
and
throw
stones
at
you
if
you
went
anear
he
was
looking
at
me
i
had
that
white
blouse
on
open
in
the
front
to
encourage
him
as
much
as
i
could
without
too
openly
they
were
just
beginning
to
be
plump
i
said
i
was
tired
we
lay
over
the
firtree
cove
a
wild
place
i
suppose
it
must
be
the
highest
rock
in
existence
the
galleries
and
casemates
and
those
frightful
rocks
and
saint
michaels
cave
with
the
icicles
or
whatever
they
call
them
hanging
down
and
ladders
all
the
mud
plotching
my
boots
im
sure
thats
the
way
down
the
monkeys
go
under
the
sea
to
africa
when
they
die
the
ships
out
far
like
chips
that
was
the
malta
boat
passing
yes
the
sea
and
the
sky
you
could
do
what
you
liked
lie
there
for
ever
he
caressed
them
outside
they
love
doing
that
its
the
roundness
there
i
was
leaning
over
him
with
my
white
ricestraw
hat
to
take
the
newness
out
of
it
the
left
side
of
my
face
the
best
my
blouse
open
for
his
last
day
transparent
kind
of
shirt
he
had
i
could
see
his
chest
pink
he
wanted
to
touch
mine
with
his
for
a
moment
but
i
wouldnt
let
him
he
was
awfully
put
out
first
for
fear
you
never
know
consumption
or
leave
me
with
a
child
embarazada
that
old
servant
ines
told
me
that
one
drop
even
if
it
got
into
you
at
all
after
i
tried
with
the
banana
but
i
was
afraid
it
might
break
and
get
lost
up
in
me
somewhere
because
they
once
took
something
down
out
of
a
woman
that
was
up
there
for
years
covered
with
limesalts
theyre
all
mad
to
get
in
there
where
they
come
out
of
youd
think
they
could
never
go
far
enough
up
and
then
theyre
done
with
you
in
a
way
till
the
next
time
yes
because
theres
a
wonderful
feeling
there
so
tender
all
the
time
how
did
we
finish
it
off
yes
o
yes
i
pulled
him
off
into
my
handkerchief
pretending
not
to
be
excited
but
i
opened
my
legs
i
wouldnt
let
him
touch
me
inside
my
petticoat
because
i
had
a
skirt
opening
up
the
side
i
tormented
the
life
out
of
him
first
tickling
him
i
loved
rousing
that
dog
in
the
hotel
rrrsssstt
awokwokawok
his
eyes
shut
and
a
bird
flying
below
us
he
was
shy
all
the
same
i
liked
him
like
that
moaning
i
made
him
blush
a
little
when
i
got
over
him
that
way
when
i
unbuttoned
him
and
took
his
out
and
drew
back
the
skin
it
had
a
kind
of
eye
in
it
theyre
all
buttons
men
down
the
middle
on
the
wrong
side
of
them
molly
darling
he
called
me
what
was
his
name
jack
joe
harry
mulvey
was
it
yes
i
think
a
lieutenant
he
was
rather
fair
he
had
a
laughing
kind
of
a
voice
so
i
went
round
to
the
whatyoucallit
everything
was
whatyoucallit
moustache
had
he
he
said
hed
come
back
lord
its
just
like
yesterday
to
me
and
if
i
was
married
hed
do
it
to
me
and
i
promised
him
yes
faithfully
id
let
him
block
me
now
flying
perhaps
hes
dead
or
killed
or
a
captain
or
admiral
its
nearly
years
if
i
said
firtree
cove
he
would
if
he
came
up
behind
me
and
put
his
hands
over
my
eyes
to
guess
who
i
might
recognise
him
hes
young
still
about
perhaps
hes
married
some
girl
on
the
black
water
and
is
quite
changed
they
all
do
they
havent
half
the
character
a
woman
has
she
little
knows
what
i
did
with
her
beloved
husband
before
he
ever
dreamt
of
her
in
broad
daylight
too
in
the
sight
of
the
whole
world
you
might
say
they
could
have
put
an
article
about
it
in
the
chronicle
i
was
a
bit
wild
after
when
i
blew
out
the
old
bag
the
biscuits
were
in
from
benady
bros
and
exploded
it
lord
what
a
bang
all
the
woodcocks
and
pigeons
screaming
coming
back
the
same
way
that
we
went
over
middle
hill
round
by
the
old
guardhouse
and
the
jews
burialplace
pretending
to
read
out
the
hebrew
on
them
i
wanted
to
fire
his
pistol
he
said
he
hadnt
one
he
didnt
know
what
to
make
of
me
with
his
peak
cap
on
that
he
always
wore
crooked
as
often
as
i
settled
it
straight
h
m
s
calypso
swinging
my
hat
that
old
bishop
that
spoke
off
the
altar
his
long
preach
about
womans
higher
functions
about
girls
now
riding
the
bicycle
and
wearing
peak
caps
and
the
new
woman
bloomers
god
send
him
sense
and
me
more
money
i
suppose
theyre
called
after
him
i
never
thought
that
would
be
my
name
bloom
when
i
used
to
write
it
in
print
to
see
how
it
looked
on
a
visiting
card
or
practising
for
the
butcher
and
oblige
m
bloom
youre
looking
blooming
josie
used
to
say
after
i
married
him
well
its
better
than
breen
or
briggs
does
brig
or
those
awful
names
with
bottom
in
them
mrs
ramsbottom
or
some
other
kind
of
a
bottom
mulvey
i
wouldnt
go
mad
about
either
or
suppose
i
divorced
him
mrs
boylan
my
mother
whoever
she
was
might
have
given
me
a
nicer
name
the
lord
knows
after
the
lovely
one
she
had
lunita
laredo
the
fun
we
had
running
along
williss
road
to
europa
point
twisting
in
and
out
all
round
the
other
side
of
jersey
they
were
shaking
and
dancing
about
in
my
blouse
like
millys
little
ones
now
when
she
runs
up
the
stairs
i
loved
looking
down
at
them
i
was
jumping
up
at
the
pepper
trees
and
the
white
poplars
pulling
the
leaves
off
and
throwing
them
at
him
he
went
to
india
he
was
to
write
the
voyages
those
men
have
to
make
to
the
ends
of
the
world
and
back
its
the
least
they
might
get
a
squeeze
or
two
at
a
woman
while
they
can
going
out
to
be
drowned
or
blown
up
somewhere
i
went
up
windmill
hill
to
the
flats
that
sunday
morning
with
captain
rubios
that
was
dead
spyglass
like
the
sentry
had
he
said
hed
have
one
or
two
from
on
board
i
wore
that
frock
from
the
b
marche
paris
and
the
coral
necklace
the
straits
shining
i
could
see
over
to
morocco
almost
the
bay
of
tangier
white
and
the
atlas
mountain
with
snow
on
it
and
the
straits
like
a
river
so
clear
harry
molly
darling
i
was
thinking
of
him
on
the
sea
all
the
time
after
at
mass
when
my
petticoat
began
to
slip
down
at
the
elevation
weeks
and
weeks
i
kept
the
handkerchief
under
my
pillow
for
the
smell
of
him
there
was
no
decent
perfume
to
be
got
in
that
gibraltar
only
that
cheap
peau
despagne
that
faded
and
left
a
stink
on
you
more
than
anything
else
i
wanted
to
give
him
a
memento
he
gave
me
that
clumsy
claddagh
ring
for
luck
that
i
gave
gardner
going
to
south
africa
where
those
boers
killed
him
with
their
war
and
fever
but
they
were
well
beaten
all
the
same
as
if
it
brought
its
bad
luck
with
it
like
an
opal
or
pearl
still
it
must
have
been
pure
carrot
gold
because
it
was
very
heavy
but
what
could
you
get
in
a
place
like
that
the
sandfrog
shower
from
africa
and
that
derelict
ship
that
came
up
to
the
harbour
marie
the
marie

slobbering
after
washing
every
bit
of
myself
back
belly
and
sides
if

even
a
bath

or

own
room

wish

bed
by

to
let
a
fart

a
bit
on
my
side

one
more
song
that
was
a
relief
wherever
you
be
let
your
wind
go
free
who
knows
if
that
pork
chop
i
took
with
my
cup
of
tea
after
was
quite
good
with
the
heat
i
couldnt
smell
anything
off
it
im
sure
that
queerlooking
man
in
the
porkbutchers
is
a
great
rogue
i
hope
that
lamp
is
not
smoking
fill
my
nose
up
with
smuts
better
than
having
him
leaving
the
gas
on
all
night
i
couldnt
rest
easy
in
my
bed
in
gibraltar
even
getting
up
to
see
why
am
i
so
damned
nervous
about
that
though
i
like
it
in
the
winter
its
more
company
o
lord
it
was
rotten
cold
too
that
winter
when
i
was
only
about
ten
was
i
yes
i
had
the
big
doll
with
all
the
funny
clothes
dressing
her
up
and
undressing
that
icy
wind
skeeting
across
from
those
mountains
the
something
nevada
sierra
nevada
standing
at
the
fire
with
the
little
bit
of
a
short
shift
i
had
up
to
heat
myself
i
loved
dancing
about
in
it
then
make
a
race
back
into
bed
im
sure
that
fellow
opposite
used
to
be
there
the
whole
time
watching
with
the
lights
out
in
the
summer
and
i
in
my
skin
hopping
around
i
used
to
love
myself
then
stripped
at
the
washstand
dabbing
and
creaming
only
when
it
came
to
the
chamber
performance
i
put
out
the
light
too
so
then
there
were
of
us
goodbye
to
my
sleep
for
this
night
anyhow
i
hope
hes
not
going
to
get
in
with
those
medicals
leading
him
astray
to
imagine
hes
young
again
coming
in
at
in
the
morning
it
must
be
if
not
more
still
he
had
the
manners
not
to
wake
me
what
do
they
find
to
gabber
about
all
night
squandering
money
and
getting
drunker
and
drunker
couldnt
they
drink
water
then
he
starts
giving
us
his
orders
for
eggs
and
tea
and
findon
haddy
and
hot
buttered
toast
i
suppose
well
have
him
sitting
up
like
the
king
of
the
country
pumping
the
wrong
end
of
the
spoon
up
and
down
in
his
egg
wherever
he
learned
that
from
and
i
love
to
hear
him
falling
up
the
stairs
of
a
morning
with
the
cups
rattling
on
the
tray
and
then
play
with
the
cat
she
rubs
up
against
you
for
her
own
sake
i
wonder
has
she
fleas
shes
as
bad
as
a
woman
always
licking
and
lecking
but
i
hate
their
claws
i
wonder
do
they
see
anything
that
we
cant
staring
like
that
when
she
sits
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
so
long
and
listening
as
i
wait
always
what
a
robber
too
that
lovely
fresh
plaice
i
bought
i
think
ill
get
a
bit
of
fish
tomorrow
or
today
is
it
friday

i
will
with
some
blancmange
with
black
currant

ago

lb
pots
of
mixed
plum
and
apple
from
the
london
and
newcastle

twice
as
far
only
for
the
bones
i
hate
those
eels
cod

a
nice
piece
of
cod

enough
for

sick
of
that
everlasting
butchers
meat
from
buckleys
loin
chops
and
leg
beef
and
rib
steak
and
scrag
of
mutton
and
calfs
pluck
the
very
name

enough
or
a
picnic
suppose
we
all
gave
each
and
or
let
him
pay
it
and
invite
some
other
woman
for
him
who
mrs
fleming
and
drove
out
to
the
furry
glen
or
the
strawberry
beds
wed
have
him
examining
all
the
horses
toenails
first
like
he
does
with
the
letters
no
not
with
boylan
there
yes
with
some
cold
veal
and
ham
mixed
sandwiches
there
are
little
houses
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
banks
there
on
purpose
but
its
as
hot
as
blazes
he
says

bank
holiday
anyhow
i
hate
those
ruck
of
mary
ann
coalboxes
out
for
the
day
whit
monday
is
a
cursed
day
too
no
wonder
that
bee
bit
him
better
the
seaside
but
id
never
again
in
this
life
get
into
a
boat
with
him
after
him
at
bray
telling
the
boatman
he
knew
how
to
row
if
anyone
asked
could
he
ride
the
steeplechase
for
the
gold
cup
hed
say
yes
then
it
came
on
to
get
rough
the
old
thing
crookeding
about
and
the
weight
all
down
my
side
telling
me
pull
the
right
reins
now
pull
the
left
and
the
tide
all
swamping
in
floods
in
through
the
bottom
and
his
oar
slipping
out
of
the
stirrup
its
a
mercy
we
werent
all
drowned
he
can
swim
of
course
me
no
theres
no
danger
whatsoever
keep
yourself
calm
in
his
flannel
trousers
id
like
to
have
tattered
them
down
off
him
before
all
the
people
and
give
him
what
that
one
calls
flagellate
till
he
was
black
and
blue
do
him
all
the
good
in
the
world
only
for
that
longnosed
chap
i
dont
know
who
he
is
with
that
other
beauty
burke
out
of
the
city
arms
hotel
was
there
spying
around
as
usual
on
the
slip
always
where
he
wasnt
wanted
if
there
was
a
row
on
youd
vomit
a
better
face
there
was
no
love
lost
between
us
thats
consolation
i
wonder
what
kind
is
that
book
he
brought
me
sweets
of
sin
by
a
gentleman
of
fashion
some
other
mr
de
kock
i
suppose
the
people
gave
him
that
nickname
going
about
with
his
tube
from
one
woman
to
another
i
couldnt
even
change
my
new
white
shoes
all
ruined
with
the
saltwater
and
the
hat
i
had
with
that
feather
all
blowy
and
tossed
on
me
how
annoying
and
provoking
because
the
smell
of
the
sea
excited
me
of
course
the
sardines
and
the
bream
in
catalan
bay
round
the
back
of
the
rock
they
were
fine
all
silver
in
the
fishermens
baskets
old
luigi
near
a
hundred
they
said
came
from
genoa
and
the
tall
old
chap
with
the
earrings
i
dont
like
a
man
you
have
to
climb
up
to
to
get
at
i
suppose
theyre
all
dead
and
rotten
long
ago
besides
i
dont
like
being
alone
in
this
big
barracks
of
a
place
at
night
i
suppose
ill
have
to
put
up
with
it
i
never
brought
a
bit
of
salt
in
even
when
we
moved
in
the
confusion
musical
academy
he
was
going
to
make
on
the
first
floor
drawingroom
with
a
brassplate
or
blooms
private
hotel
he
suggested
go
and
ruin
himself
altogether
the
way
his
father
did
down
in
ennis
like
all
the
things
he
told
father
he
was
going
to
do
and
me
but
i
saw
through
him
telling
me
all
the
lovely
places
we
could
go
for
the
honeymoon
venice
by
moonlight
with
the
gondolas
and
the
lake
of
como
he
had
a
picture
cut
out
of
some
paper
of
and
mandolines
and
lanterns
o
how
nice
i
said
whatever
i
liked
he
was
going
to
do
immediately
if
not
sooner
will
you
be
my
man
will
you
carry
my
can
he
ought
to
get
a
leather
medal
with
a
putty
rim
for
all
the
plans
he
invents
then
leaving
us
here
all
day
youd
never
know
what
old
beggar
at
the
door
for
a
crust
with
his
long
story
might
be
a
tramp
and
put
his
foot
in
the
way
to
prevent
me
shutting
it
like
that
picture
of
that
hardened
criminal
he
was
called
in
lloyds
weekly
news
years
in
jail
then
he
comes
out
and
murders
an
old
woman
for
her
money
imagine
his
poor
wife
or
mother
or
whoever
she
is
such
a
face
youd
run
miles
away
from
i
couldnt
rest
easy
till
i
bolted
all
the
doors
and
windows
to
make
sure
but
its
worse
again
being
locked
up
like
in
a
prison
or
a
madhouse
they
ought
to
be
all
shot
or
the
cat
of
nine
tails
a
big
brute
like
that
that
would
attack
a
poor
old
woman
to
murder
her
in
her
bed
id
cut
them
off
him
so
i
would
not
that
hed
be
much
use
still
better
than
nothing
the
night
i
was
sure
i
heard
burglars
in
the
kitchen
and
he
went
down
in
his
shirt
with
a
candle
and
a
poker
as
if
he
was
looking
for
a
mouse
as
white
as
a
sheet
frightened
out
of
his
wits
making
as
much
noise
as
he
possibly
could
for
the
burglars
benefit
there
isnt
much
to
steal
indeed
the
lord
knows
still
its
the
feeling
especially
now
with
milly
away
such
an
idea
for
him
to
send
the
girl
down
there
to
learn
to
take
photographs
on
account
of
his
grandfather
instead
of
sending
her
to
skerrys
academy
where
shed
have
to
learn
not
like
me
getting
all
at
school
only
hed
do
a
thing
like
that
all
the
same
on
account
of
me
and
boylan
thats
why
he
did
it
im
certain
the
way
he
plots
and
plans
everything
out
i
couldnt
turn
round
with
her
in
the
place
lately
unless
i
bolted
the
door
first
gave
me
the
fidgets
coming
in
without
knocking
first
when
i
put
the
chair
against
the
door
just
as
i
was
washing
myself
there
below
with
the
glove
get
on
your
nerves
then
doing
the
loglady
all
day
put
her
in
a
glasscase
with
two
at
a
time
to
look
at
her
if
he
knew
she
broke
off
the
hand
off
that
little
gimcrack
statue
with
her
roughness
and
carelessness
before
she
left
that
i
got
that
little
italian
boy
to
mend
so
that
you
cant
see
the
join
for
shillings
wouldnt
even
teem
the
potatoes
for
you
of
course
shes
right
not
to
ruin
her
hands
i
noticed
he
was
always
talking
to
her
lately
at
the
table
explaining
things
in
the
paper
and
she
pretending
to
understand
sly
of
course
that
comes
from
his
side
of
the
house
he
cant
say
i
pretend
things
can
he
im
too
honest
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
helping
her
into
her
coat
but
if
there
was
anything
wrong
with
her
its
me
shed
tell
not
him
i
suppose
he
thinks
im
finished
out
and
laid
on
the
shelf
well
im
not
no
nor
anything
like
it
well
see
well
see
now
shes
well
on
for
flirting
too
with
tom
devans
two
sons
imitating
me
whistling
with
those
romps
of
murray
girls
calling
for
her
can
milly
come
out
please
shes
in
great
demand
to
pick
what
they
can
out
of
her
round
in
nelson
street
riding
harry
devans
bicycle
at
night
its
as
well
he
sent
her
where
she
is
she
was
just
getting
out
of
bounds
wanting
to
go
on
the
skatingrink
and
smoking
their
cigarettes
through
their
nose
i
smelt
it
off
her
dress
when
i
was
biting
off
the
thread
of
the
button
i
sewed
on
to
the
bottom
of
her
jacket
she
couldnt
hide
much
from
me
i
tell
you
only
i
oughtnt
to
have
stitched
it
and
it
on
her
it
brings
a
parting
and
the
last
plumpudding
too
split
in
halves
see
it
comes
out
no
matter
what
they
say
her
tongue
is
a
bit
too
long
for
my
taste
your
blouse
is
open
too
low
she
says
to
me
the
pan
calling
the
kettle
blackbottom
and
i
had
to
tell
her
not
to
cock
her
legs
up
like
that
on
show
on
the
windowsill
before
all
the
people
passing
they
all
look
at
her
like
me
when
i
was
her
age
of
course
any
old
rag
looks
well
on
you
then
a
great
touchmenot
too
in
her
own
way
at
the
only
way
in
the
theatre
royal
take
your
foot
away
out
of
that
i
hate
people
touching
me
afraid
of
her
life
id
crush
her
skirt
with
the
pleats
a
lot
of
that
touching
must
go
on
in
theatres
in
the
crush
in
the
dark
theyre
always
trying
to
wiggle
up
to
you
that
fellow
in
the
pit
at
the
gaiety
for
beerbohm
tree
in
trilby
the
last
time
ill
ever
go
there
to
be
squashed
like
that
for
any
trilby
or
her
barebum
every
two
minutes
tipping
me
there
and
looking
away
hes
a
bit
daft
i
think
i
saw
him
after
trying
to
get
near
two
stylishdressed
ladies
outside
switzers
window
at
the
same
little
game
i
recognised
him
on
the
moment
the
face
and
everything
but
he
didnt
remember
me
yes
and
she
didnt
even
want
me
to
kiss
her
at
the
broadstone
going
away
well
i
hope
shell
get
someone
to
dance
attendance
on
her
the
way
i
did
when
she
was
down
with
the
mumps
and
her
glands
swollen
wheres
this
and
wheres
that
of
course
she
cant
feel
anything
deep
yet
i
never
came
properly
till
i
was
what
or
so
it
went
into
the
wrong
place
always
only
the
usual
girls
nonsense
and
giggling
that
conny
connolly
writing
to
her
in
white
ink
on
black
paper
sealed
with
sealingwax
though
she
clapped
when
the
curtain
came
down
because
he
looked
so
handsome
then
we
had
martin
harvey
for
breakfast
dinner
and
supper
i
thought
to
myself
afterwards
it
must
be
real
love
if
a
man
gives
up
his
life
for
her
that
way
for
nothing
i
suppose
there
are
a
few
men
like
that
left
its
hard
to
believe
in
it
though
unless
it
really
happened
to
me
the
majority
of
them
with
not
a
particle
of
love
in
their
natures
to
find
two
people
like
that
nowadays
full
up
of
each
other
that
would
feel
the
same
way
as
you
do
theyre
usually
a
bit
foolish
in
the
head
his
father
must
have
been
a
bit
queer
to
go
and
poison
himself
after
her
still
poor
old
man
i
suppose
he
felt
lost
shes
always
making
love
to
my
things
too
the
few
old
rags
i
have
wanting
to
put
her
hair
up
at
my
powder
too
only
ruin
her
skin
on
her
shes
time
enough
for
that
all
her
life
after
of
course
shes
restless
knowing
shes
pretty
with
her
lips
so
red
a
pity
they
wont
stay
that
way
i
was
too
but
theres
no
use
going
to
the
fair
with
the
thing
answering
me
like
a
fishwoman
when
i
asked
to
go
for
a
half
a
stone
of
potatoes
the
day
we
met
mrs
joe
gallaher
at
the
trottingmatches
and
she
pretended
not
to
see
us
in
her
trap
with
friery
the
solicitor
we
werent
grand
enough
till
i
gave
her
damn
fine
cracks
across
the
ear
for
herself
take
that
now
for
answering
me
like
that
and
that
for
your
impudence
she
had
me
that
exasperated
of
course
contradicting
i
was
badtempered
too
because
how
was
it
there
was
a
weed
in
the
tea
or
i
didnt
sleep
the
night
before
cheese
i
ate
was
it
and
i
told
her
over
and
over
again
not
to
leave
knives
crossed
like
that
because
she
has
nobody
to
command
her
as
she
said
herself
well
if
he
doesnt
correct
her
faith
i
will
that
was
the
last
time
she
turned
on
the
teartap
i
was
just
like
that
myself
they
darent
order
me
about
the
place
its
his
fault
of
course
having
the
two
of
us
slaving
here
instead
of
getting
in
a
woman
long
ago
am
i
ever
going
to
have
a
proper
servant
again
of
course
then
shed
see
him
coming
id
have
to
let
her
know
or
shed
revenge
it
arent
they
a
nuisance
that
old
mrs
fleming
you
have
to
be
walking
round
after
her
putting
the
things
into
her
hands
sneezing
and
farting
into
the
pots
well
of
course
shes
old
she
cant
help
it
a
good
job
i
found
that
rotten
old
smelly
dishcloth
that
got
lost
behind
the
dresser
i
knew
there
was
something
and
opened
the
area
window
to
let
out
the
smell
bringing
in
his
friends
to
entertain
them
like
the
night
he
walked
home
with
a
dog
if
you
please
that
might
have
been
mad
especially
simon
dedalus
son
his
father
such
a
criticiser
with
his
glasses
up
with
his
tall
hat
on
him
at
the
cricket
match
and
a
great
big
hole
in
his
sock
one
thing
laughing
at
the
other
and
his
son
that
got
all
those
prizes
for
whatever
he
won
them
in
the
intermediate
imagine
climbing
over
the
railings
if
anybody
saw
him
that
knew
us
i
wonder
he
didnt
tear
a
big
hole
in
his
grand
funeral
trousers
as
if
the
one
nature
gave
wasnt
enough
for
anybody
hawking
him
down
into
the
dirty
old
kitchen
now
is
he
right
in
his
head
i
ask
pity
it
wasnt
washing
day
my
old
pair
of
drawers
might
have
been
hanging
up
too
on
the
line
on
exhibition
for
all
hed
ever
care
with
the
ironmould
mark
the
stupid
old
bundle
burned
on
them
he
might
think
was
something
else
and
she
never
even
rendered
down
the
fat
i
told
her
and
now
shes
going
such
as
she
was
on
account
of
her
paralysed
husband
getting
worse
theres
always
something
wrong
with
them
disease
or
they
have
to
go
under
an
operation
or
if

someone
every
day

some
new
thing
on
sweet
god
sweet

minute

thing

poking
and
rooting
and
ploughing
he

up
in
me
now
what

that
pester
the
soul
out
of
a
body
unless

it
some
men
do
god
knows
theres
always
something
wrong
with
us
days
every
or
weeks
usual
monthly
auction
isnt
it
simply
sickening
that
night
it
came
on
me
like
that
the
one
and
only
time
we
were
in
a
box
that
michael
gunn
gave
him
to
see
mrs
kendal
and
her
husband
at
the
gaiety
something
he
did
about
insurance
for
him
in
drimmies
i
was
fit
to
be
tied
though
i
wouldnt
give
in
with
that
gentleman
of
fashion
staring
down
at
me
with
his
glasses
and
him
the
other
side
of
me
talking
about
spinoza
and
his
soul
thats
dead
i
suppose
millions
of
years
ago
i
smiled
the
best
i
could
all
in
a
swamp
leaning
forward
as
if
i
was
interested
having
to
sit
it
out
then
to
the
last
tag
i
wont
forget
that
wife
of
scarli
in
a
hurry
supposed
to
be
a
fast
play
about
adultery
that
idiot
in
the
gallery
hissing
the
woman
adulteress
he
shouted
i
suppose
he
went
and
had
a
woman
in
the
next
lane
running
round
all
the
back
ways
after
to
make
up
for
it
i
wish
he
had
what
i
had
then
hed
boo
i
bet
the
cat
itself
is
better
off
than
us
have
we
too
much
blood
up
in
us
or
what
o
patience
above
its
pouring
out
of
me
like
the
sea
anyhow
he
didnt
make
me
pregnant
as
big
as
he
is
i
dont
want
to
ruin
the
clean
sheets
i
just
put
on
i
suppose
the
clean
linen
i
wore
brought
it
on
too
damn
it
damn
it
and
they
always
want
to
see
a
stain
on
the
bed
to
know
youre
a
virgin
for
them
all
thats
troubling
them
theyre
such
fools
too
you
could
be
a
widow
or
divorced
times
over
a
daub
of
red
ink
would
do
or
blackberry
juice
no
thats
too
purply
o
jamesy
let
me
up
out
of
this
pooh
sweets
of
sin
whoever
suggested
that
business
for
women
what
between
clothes
and
cooking
and
children
this
damned
old
bed
too
jingling
like
the
dickens
i
suppose
they
could
hear
us
away
over
the
other
side
of
the
park
till
i
suggested
to
put
the
quilt
on
the
floor
with
the
pillow
under
my
bottom
i
wonder
is
it
nicer
in
the
day
i
think
it
is
easy
i
think
ill
cut
all
this
hair
off
me
there
scalding
me
i
might
look
like
a
young
girl
wouldnt
he
get
the
great
suckin
the
next
time
he
turned
up
my
clothes
on
me
id
give
anything
to
see
his
face
wheres
the
chamber
gone
easy
ive
a
holy
horror
of
its
breaking
under
me
after
that
old
commode
i
wonder
was
i
too
heavy
sitting
on
his
knee
i
made
him
sit
on
the
easychair
purposely
when
i
took
off
only
my
blouse
and
skirt
first
in
the
other
room
he
was
so
busy
where
he
oughtnt
to
be
he
never
felt
me
i
hope
my
breath
was
sweet
after
those
kissing
comfits
easy
god
i
remember
one
time
i
could
scout
it
out
straight
whistling
like
a
man
almost
easy
o
lord
how
noisy
i
hope
theyre
bubbles
on
it
for
a
wad
of
money
from
some
fellow
ill
have
to
perfume
it
in
the
morning
dont
forget
i
bet
he
never
saw
a
better
pair
of
thighs
than
that
look
how
white
they
are
the
smoothest
place
is
right
there
between
this
bit
here
how
soft
like
a
peach
easy
god
i
wouldnt
mind
being
a
man
and
get
up
on
a
lovely
woman
o
lord
what
a
row
youre
making
like
the
jersey
lily
easy
easy
o
how
the
waters
come
down
at
lahore
who
knows
is
there
anything
the
matter
with
my
insides
or
have
i
something
growing
in
me
getting
that
thing
like
that
every
week
when
was
it
last
i
whit
monday
yes
its
only
about
weeks
i
ought
to
go
to
the
doctor
only
it
would
be
like
before
i
married
him
when
i
had
that
white
thing
coming
from
me
and
floey
made
me
go
to
that
dry
old
stick
dr
collins
for
womens
diseases
on
pembroke
road
your
vagina
he
called
it
i
suppose
thats
how
he
got
all
the
gilt
mirrors
and
carpets
getting
round
those
rich
ones
off
stephens
green
running
up
to
him
for
every
little
fiddlefaddle
her
vagina
and
her
cochinchina
theyve
money
of
course
so
theyre
all
right
i
wouldnt
marry
him
not
if
he
was
the
last
man
in
the
world
besides
theres
something
queer
about
their
children
always
smelling
around
those
filthy
bitches
all
sides
asking
me
if
what
i
did
had
an
offensive
odour
what
did
he
want
me
to
do
but
the
one
thing
gold
maybe
what
a
question
if
i
smathered
it
all
over
his
wrinkly
old
face
for
him
with
all
my
compriment
i
suppose
hed
know
then
and
could
you
pass
it
easily
pass
what
i
thought
he
was
talking
about
the
rock
of
gibraltar
the
way
he
put
it
thats
a
very
nice
invention
too
by
the
way
only
i
like
letting
myself
down
after
in
the
hole
as
far
as
i
can
squeeze
and
pull
the
chain
then
to
flush
it
nice
cool
pins
and
needles
still
theres
something
in
it
i
suppose
i
always
used
to
know
by
millys
when
she
was
a
child
whether
she
had
worms
or
not
still
all
the
same
paying
him
for
that
how
much
is
that
doctor
one
guinea
please
and
asking
me
had
i
frequent
omissions
where
do
those
old
fellows
get
all
the
words
they
have
omissions
with
his
shortsighted
eyes
on
me
cocked
sideways
i
wouldnt
trust
him
too
far
to
give
me
chloroform
or
god
knows
what
else
still
i
liked
him
when
he
sat
down
to
write
the
thing
out
frowning
so
severe
his
nose
intelligent
like
that
you
be
damned
you
lying
strap
o
anything
no
matter
who
except
an
idiot
he
was
clever
enough
to
spot
that
of
course
that
was
all
thinking
of
him
and
his
mad
crazy
letters
my
precious
one
everything
connected
with
your
glorious
body
everything
underlined
that
comes
from
it
is
a
thing
of
beauty
and
of
joy
for
ever
something
he
got
out
of
some
nonsensical
book
that
he
had
me
always
at
myself
and
times
a
day
sometimes
and
i
said
i
hadnt
are
you
sure
o
yes
i
said
i
am
quite
sure
in
a
way
that
shut
him
up
i
knew
what
was
coming
next
only
natural
weakness
it
was
he
excited
me
i
dont
know
how
the
first
night
ever
we
met
when
i
was
living
in
rehoboth
terrace
we
stood
staring
at
one
another
for
about
minutes
as
if
we
met
somewhere
i
suppose
on
account
of
my
being
jewess
looking
after
my
mother
he
used
to
amuse
me
the
things
he
said
with
the
half
sloothering
smile
on
him
and
all
the
doyles
said
he
was
going
to
stand
for
a
member
of
parliament
o
wasnt
i
the
born
fool
to
believe
all
his
blather
about
home
rule
and
the
land
league
sending
me
that
long
strool
of
a
song
out
of
the
huguenots
to
sing
in
french
to
be
more
classy
o
beau
pays
de
la
touraine
that
i
never
even
sang
once
explaining
and
rigmaroling
about
religion
and
persecution
he
wont
let
you
enjoy
anything
naturally
then
might
he
as
a
great
favour
the
very
opportunity
he
got
a
chance
in
brighton
square
running
into
my
bedroom
pretending
the
ink
got
on
his
hands
to
wash
it
off
with
the
albion
milk
and
sulphur
soap
i
used
to
use
and
the
gelatine
still
round
it
o
i
laughed
myself
sick
at
him
that
day
i
better
not
make
an
alnight
sitting
on
this
affair
they
ought
to
make
chambers
a
natural
size
so
that
a
woman
could
sit
on
it
properly
he
kneels
down
to
do
it
i
suppose
there
isnt
in
all
creation
another
man
with
the
habits
he
has
look
at
the
way
hes
sleeping
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
how
can
he
without
a
hard
bolster
its
well
he
doesnt
kick
or
he
might
knock
out
all
my
teeth
breathing
with
his
hand
on
his
nose
like
that
indian
god
he
took
me
to
show
one
wet
sunday
in
the
museum
in
kildare
street
all
yellow
in
a
pinafore
lying
on
his
side
on
his
hand
with
his
ten
toes
sticking
out
that
he
said
was
a
bigger
religion
than
the
jews
and
our
lords
both
put
together
all
over
asia
imitating
him
as
hes
always
imitating
everybody
i
suppose
he
used
to
sleep
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
too
with
his
big
square
feet
up
in
his
wifes
mouth
damn
this
stinking
thing
anyway
wheres
this
those
napkins
are
ah
yes
i
know
i
hope
the
old
press
doesnt
creak
ah
i
knew
it
would
hes
sleeping
hard
had
a
good
time
somewhere
still
she
must
have
given
him
great
value
for
his
money
of
course
he
has
to
pay
for
it
from
her
o
this
nuisance
of
a
thing
i
hope
theyll
have
something
better
for
us
in
the
other
world
tying
ourselves
up
god
help
us
thats
all
right
for
tonight
now
the
lumpy
old
jingly
bed
always
reminds
me
of
old
cohen
i
suppose
he
scratched
himself
in
it
often
enough
and
he
thinks
father
bought
it
from
lord
napier
that
i
used
to
admire
when
i
was
a
little
girl
because
i
told
him
easy
piano
o
i
like
my
bed
god
here
we
are
as
bad
as
ever
after
years
how
many
houses
were
we
in
at
all
raymond
terrace
and
ontario
terrace
and
lombard
street
and
holles
street
and
he
goes
about
whistling
every
time
were
on
the
run
again
his
huguenots
or
the
frogs
march
pretending
to
help
the
men
with
our
sticks
of
furniture
and
then
the
city
arms
hotel
worse
and
worse
says
warden
daly
that
charming
place
on
the
landing
always
somebody
inside
praying
then
leaving
all
their
stinks
after
them
always
know
who
was
in
there
last
every
time
were
just
getting
on
right
something
happens
or
he
puts
his
big
foot
in
it
thoms
and
helys
and
mr
cuffes
and
drimmies
either
hes
going
to
be
run
into
prison
over
his
old
lottery
tickets
that
was
to
be
all
our
salvations
or
he
goes
and
gives
impudence
well
have
him
coming
home
with
the
sack
soon
out
of
the
freeman
too
like
the
rest
on
account
of
those
sinner
fein
or
the
freemasons
then
well
see
if
the
little
man
he
showed
me
dribbling
along
in
the
wet
all
by
himself
round
by
coadys
lane
will
give
him
much
consolation
that
he
says
is
so
capable
and
sincerely
irish
he
is
indeed
judging
by
the
sincerity
of
the
trousers
i
saw
on
him
wait
theres
georges
church
bells
wait
quarters
the
hour
wait
two
oclock
well
thats
a
nice
hour
of
the
night
for
him
to
be
coming
home
at
to
anybody
climbing
down
into
the
area
if
anybody
saw
him
ill
knock
him
off
that
little
habit
tomorrow
first
ill
look
at
his
shirt
to
see
or
ill
see
if
he
has
that
french
letter
still
in
his
pocketbook
i
suppose
he
thinks
i
dont
know
deceitful
men
all
their
pockets
arent
enough
for
their
lies
then
why
should
we
tell
them
even
if
its
the
truth
they
dont
believe
you
then
tucked
up
in
bed
like
those
babies
in
the
aristocrats
masterpiece
he
brought
me
another
time
as
if
we
hadnt
enough
of
that
in
real
life
without
some
old
aristocrat
or
whatever
his
name
is
disgusting
you
more
with
those
rotten
pictures
children
with
two
heads
and
no
legs
thats
the
kind
of
villainy
theyre
always
dreaming
about
with
not
another
thing
in
their
empty
heads
they
ought
to
get
slow
poison
the
half
of
them
then
tea
and
toast
for
him
buttered
on
both
sides
and
newlaid
eggs
i
suppose
im
nothing
any
more
when
i
wouldnt
let
him
lick
me
in
holles
street
one
night
man
man
tyrant
as
ever
for
the
one
thing
he
slept
on
the
floor
half
the
night
naked
the
way
the
jews
used
when
somebody
dies
belonged
to
them
and
wouldnt
eat
any
breakfast
or
speak
a
word
wanting
to
be
petted
so
i
thought
i
stood
out
enough
for
one
time
and
let
him
he
does
it
all
wrong
too
thinking
only
of
his
own
pleasure
his
tongue
is
too
flat
or
i
dont
know
what
he
forgets
that
we
then
i
dont
ill
make
him
do
it
again
if
he
doesnt
mind
himself
and
lock
him
down
to
sleep
in
the
coalcellar
with
the
blackbeetles
i
wonder
was
it
her
josie
off
her
head
with
my
castoffs
hes
such
a
born
liar
too
no
hed
never
have
the
courage
with
a
married
woman
thats
why
he
wants
me
and
boylan
though
as
for
her
denis
as
she
calls
him
that
forlornlooking
spectacle

to
wink

way

money

is
the
fruits
of
mr

in
the
paper

in
if
they
saw
a
real
officers

the
poor
horse

behind

black
l
boom
and
tom
kernan
that
drunken
little
barrelly
man

bit
his
tongue

white
head
of
cabbage
skinny
thing
with
a
turn
in
her
eye
trying
to
sing
my
songs
shed
want
to
be
born
all
over
again
and
her
old
green
dress
with
the
lowneck
as
she
cant
attract
them
any
other
way
like
dabbling
on
a
rainy
day
i
see
it
all
now
plainly
and
they
call
that
friendship
killing
and
then
burying
one
another
and
they
all
with
their
wives
and
families
at
home
more
especially
jack
power
keeping
that
barmaid
he
does
of
course
his
wife
is
always
sick
or
going
to
be
sick
or
just
getting
better
of
it
and
hes
a
goodlooking
man
still
though
hes
getting
a
bit
grey
over
the
ears
theyre
a
nice
lot
all
of
them
well
theyre
not
going
to
get
my
husband
again
into
their
clutches
if
i
can
help
it
making
fun
of
him
then
behind
his
back
i
know
well
when
he
goes
on
with
his
idiotics
because
he
has
sense
enough
not
to
squander
every
penny
piece
he
earns
down
their
gullets
and
looks
after
his
wife
and
family
goodfornothings
poor
paddy
dignam
all
the
same
im
sorry
in
a
way
for
him
what
are
his
wife
and
children
going
to
do
unless
he
was
insured
comical
little
teetotum
always
stuck
up
in
some
pub
corner
and
her
or
her
son
waiting
bill
bailey
wont
you
please
come
home
her
widows
weeds
wont
improve
her
appearance
theyre
awfully
becoming
though
if
youre
goodlooking
what
men
wasnt
he
yes
he
was
at
the
glencree
dinner
and
ben
dollard
base
barreltone
the
night
he
borrowed
the
swallowtail
to
sing
out
of
in
holles
street
squeezed
and
squashed
into
them
and
grinning
all
over
his
big
dolly
face
like
a
wellwhipped
childs
botty
didnt
he
look
a
balmy
ballocks
sure
enough
that
must
have
been
a
spectacle
on
the
stage
imagine
paying
in
the
preserved
seats
for
that
to
see
him
trotting
off
in
his
trowlers
and
simon
dedalus
too
he
was
always
turning
up
half
screwed
singing
the
second
verse
first
the
old
love
is
the
new
was
one
of
his
so
sweetly
sang
the
maiden
on
the
hawthorn
bough
he
was
always
on
for
flirtyfying
too
when
i
sang
maritana
with
him
at
freddy
mayers
private
opera
he
had
a
delicious
glorious
voice
phoebe
dearest
goodbye
sweetheart
sweetheart
he
always
sang
it
not
like
bartell
darcy
sweet
goodbye
of
course
he
had
the
gift
of
the
voice
so
there
was
no
art
in
it
all
over
you
like
a
warm
showerbath
o
maritana
wildwood
flower
we
sang
splendidly
though
it
was
a
bit
too
high
for
my
register
even
transposed
and
he
was
married
at
the
time
to
may
goulding
but
then
hed
say
or
do
something
to
knock
the
good
out
of
it
hes
a
widower
now
i
wonder
what
sort
is
his
son
he
says
hes
an
author
and
going
to
be
a
university
professor
of
italian
and
im
to
take
lessons
what
is
he
driving
at
now
showing
him
my
photo
its
not
good
of
me
i
ought
to
have
got
it
taken
in
drapery
that
never
looks
out
of
fashion
still
i
look
young
in
it
i
wonder
he
didnt
make
him
a
present
of
it
altogether
and
me
too
after
all
why
not
i
saw
him
driving
down
to
the
kingsbridge
station
with
his
father
and
mother
i
was
in
mourning
thats
years
ago
now
yes
hed
be
though
what
was
the
good
in
going
into
mourning
for
what
was
neither
one
thing
nor
the
other
the
first
cry
was
enough
for
me
i
heard
the
deathwatch
too
ticking
in
the
wall
of
course
he
insisted
hed
go
into
mourning
for
the
cat
i
suppose
hes
a
man
now
by
this
time
he
was
an
innocent
boy
then
and
a
darling
little
fellow
in
his
lord
fauntleroy
suit
and
curly
hair
like
a
prince
on
the
stage
when
i
saw
him
at
mat
dillons
he
liked
me
too
i
remember
they
all
do
wait
by
god
yes
wait
yes
hold
on
he
was
on
the
cards
this
morning
when
i
laid
out
the
deck
union
with
a
young
stranger
neither
dark
nor
fair
you
met
before
i
thought
it
meant
him
but
hes
no
chicken
nor
a
stranger
either
besides
my
face
was
turned
the
other
way
what
was
the
card
after
that
the
of
spades
for
a
journey
by
land
then
there
was
a
letter
on
its
way
and
scandals
too
the
queens
and
the
of
diamonds
for
a
rise
in
society
yes
wait
it
all
came
out
and
red
for
new
garments
look
at
that
and
didnt
i
dream
something
too
yes
there
was
something
about
poetry
in
it
i
hope
he
hasnt
long
greasy
hair
hanging
into
his
eyes
or
standing
up
like
a
red
indian
what
do
they
go
about
like
that
for
only
getting
themselves
and
their
poetry
laughed
at
i
always
liked
poetry
when
i
was
a
girl
first
i
thought
he
was
a
poet
like
lord
byron
and
not
an
ounce
of
it
in
his
composition
i
thought
he
was
quite
different
i
wonder
is
he
too
young
hes
about
wait
i
was
married
milly
is
yesterday
what
age
was
he
then
at
dillons
or
about
i
suppose
hes
or
more
im
not
too
old
for
him
if
hes
or
i
hope
hes
not
that
stuckup
university
student
sort
no
otherwise
he
wouldnt
go
sitting
down
in
the
old
kitchen
with
him
taking
eppss
cocoa
and
talking
of
course
he
pretended
to
understand
it
all
probably
he
told
him
he
was
out
of
trinity
college
hes
very
young
to
be
a
professor
i
hope
hes
not
a
professor
like
goodwin
was
he
was
a
potent
professor
of
john
jameson
they
all
write
about
some
woman
in
their
poetry
well
i
suppose
he
wont
find
many
like
me
where
softly
sighs
of
love
the
light
guitar
where
poetry
is
in
the
air
the
blue
sea
and
the
moon
shining
so
beautifully
coming
back
on
the
nightboat
from
tarifa
the
lighthouse
at
europa
point
the
guitar
that
fellow
played
was
so
expressive
will
i
ever
go
back
there
again
all
new
faces
two
glancing
eyes
a
lattice
hid
ill
sing
that
for
him
theyre
my
eyes
if
hes
anything
of
a
poet
two
eyes
as
darkly
bright
as
loves
own
star
arent
those
beautiful
words
as
loves
young
star
itll
be
a
change
the
lord
knows
to
have
an
intelligent
person
to
talk
to
about
yourself
not
always
listening
to
him
and
billy
prescotts
ad
and
keyess
ad
and
tom
the
devils
ad
then
if
anything
goes
wrong
in
their
business
we
have
to
suffer
im
sure
hes
very
distinguished
id
like
to
meet
a
man
like
that
god
not
those
other
ruck
besides
hes
young
those
fine
young
men
i
could
see
down
in
margate
strand
bathingplace
from
the
side
of
the
rock
standing
up
in
the
sun
naked
like
a
god
or
something
and
then
plunging
into
the
sea
with
them
why
arent
all
men
like
that
thered
be
some
consolation
for
a
woman
like
that
lovely
little
statue
he
bought
i
could
look
at
him
all
day
long
curly
head
and
his
shoulders
his
finger
up
for
you
to
listen
theres
real
beauty
and
poetry
for
you
i
often
felt
i
wanted
to
kiss
him
all
over
also
his
lovely
young
cock
there
so
simple
i
wouldnt
mind
taking
him
in
my
mouth
if
nobody
was
looking
as
if
it
was
asking
you
to
suck
it
so
clean
and
white
he
looks
with
his
boyish
face
i
would
too
in
a
minute
even
if
some
of
it
went
down
what
its
only
like
gruel
or
the
dew
theres
no
danger
besides
hed
be
so
clean
compared
with
those
pigs
of
men
i
suppose
never
dream
of
washing
it
from
years
end
to
the
other
the
most
of
them
only
thats
what
gives
the
women
the
moustaches
im
sure
itll
be
grand
if
i
can
only
get
in
with
a
handsome
young
poet
at
my
age
ill
throw
them
the
thing
in
the
morning
till
i
see
if
the
wishcard
comes
out
or
ill
try
pairing
the
lady
herself
and
see
if
he
comes
out
ill
read
and
study
all
i
can
find
or
learn
a
bit
off
by
heart
if
i
knew
who
he
likes
so
he
wont
think
me
stupid
if
he
thinks
all
women
are
the
same
and
i
can
teach
him
the
other
part
ill
make
him
feel
all
over
him
till
he
half
faints
under
me
then
hell
write
about
me
lover
and
mistress
publicly
too
with
our
photographs
in
all
the
papers
when
he
becomes
famous
o
but
then
what
am
i
going
to
do
about
him
though
no
thats
no
way
for
him
has
he
no
manners
nor
no
refinement
nor
no
nothing
in
his
nature
slapping
us
behind
like
that
on
my
bottom
because
i
didnt
call
him
hugh
the
ignoramus
that
doesnt
know
poetry
from
a
cabbage
thats
what
you
get
for
not
keeping
them
in
their
proper
place
pulling
off
his
shoes
and
trousers
there
on
the
chair
before
me
so
barefaced
without
even
asking
permission
and
standing
out
that
vulgar
way
in
the
half
of
a
shirt
they
wear
to
be
admired
like
a
priest
or
a
butcher
or
those
old
hypocrites
in
the
time
of
julius
caesar
of
course
hes
right
enough
in
his
way
to
pass
the
time
as
a
joke
sure
you
might
as
well
be
in
bed
with
what
with
a
lion
god
im
sure
hed
have
something
better
to
say
for
himself
an
old
lion
would
o
well
i
suppose
its
because
they
were
so
plump
and
tempting
in
my
short
petticoat
he
couldnt
resist
they
excite
myself
sometimes
its
well
for
men
all
the
amount
of
pleasure
they
get
off
a
womans
body
were
so
round
and
white
for
them
always
i
wished
i
was
one
myself
for
a
change
just
to
try
with
that
thing
they
have
swelling
up
on
you
so
hard
and
at
the
same
time
so
soft
when
you
touch
it
my
uncle
john
has
a
thing
long
i
heard
those
cornerboys
saying
passing
the
comer
of
marrowbone
lane
my
aunt
mary
has
a
thing
hairy
because
it
was
dark
and
they
knew
a
girl
was
passing
it
didnt
make
me
blush
why
should
it
either
its
only
nature
and
he
puts
his
thing
long
into
my
aunt
marys
hairy
etcetera
and
turns
out
to
be
you
put
the
handle
in
a
sweepingbrush
men
again
all
over
they
can
pick
and
choose
what
they
please
a
married
woman
or
a
fast
widow
or
a
girl
for
their
different
tastes
like
those
houses
round
behind
irish
street
no
but
were
to
be
always
chained
up
theyre
not
going
to
be
chaining
me
up
no
damn
fear
once
i
start
i
tell
you
for
their
stupid
husbands
jealousy
why
cant
we
all
remain
friends
over
it
instead
of
quarrelling
her
husband
found
it
out
what
they
did
together
well
naturally
and
if
he
did
can
he
undo
it
hes
coronado
anyway
whatever
he
does
and
then
he
going
to
the
other
mad
extreme
about
the
wife
in
fair
tyrants
of
course
the
man
never
even
casts
a
thought
on
the
husband
or
wife
either
its
the
woman
he
wants
and
he
gets
her
what
else
were
we
given
all
those
desires
for
id
like
to
know
i
cant
help
it
if
im
young
still
can
i
its
a
wonder
im
not
an
old
shrivelled
hag
before
my
time
living
with
him
so
cold
never
embracing
me
except
sometimes
when
hes
asleep
the
wrong
end
of
me
not
knowing
i
suppose
who
he
has
any
man
thatd
kiss
a
womans
bottom
id
throw
my
hat
at
him
after
that
hed
kiss
anything
unnatural
where
we
havent
atom
of
any
kind
of
expression
in
us
all
of
us
the
same
lumps
of
lard
before
ever
id
do
that
to
a
man
pfooh
the
dirty
brutes
the
mere
thought
is
enough
i
kiss
the
feet
of
you
senorita
theres
some
sense
in
that
didnt
he
kiss
our
halldoor
yes
he
did
what
a
madman
nobody
understands
his
cracked
ideas
but
me
still
of
course
a
woman
wants
to
be
embraced
times
a
day
almost
to
make
her
look
young
no
matter
by
who
so
long
as
to
be
in
love
or
loved
by
somebody
if
the
fellow
you
want
isnt
there
sometimes
by
the
lord
god
i
was
thinking
would
i
go
around
by
the
quays
there
some
dark
evening
where
nobodyd
know
me
and
pick
up
a
sailor
off
the
sea
thatd
be
hot
on
for
it
and
not
care
a
pin
whose
i
was
only
do
it
off
up
in
a
gate
somewhere
or
one
of
those
wildlooking
gipsies
in
rathfarnham
had
their
camp
pitched
near
the
bloomfield
laundry
to
try
and
steal
our
things
if
they
could
i
only
sent
mine
there
a
few
times
for
the
name
model
laundry
sending
me
back
over
and
over
some
old
ones
odd
stockings
that
blackguardlooking
fellow
with
the
fine
eyes
peeling
a
switch
attack
me
in
the
dark
and
ride
me
up
against
the
wall
without
a
word
or
a
murderer
anybody
what
they
do
themselves
the
fine
gentlemen
in
their
silk
hats
that
k
c
lives
up
somewhere
this
way
coming
out
of
hardwicke
lane
the
night
he
gave
us
the
fish
supper
on
account
of
winning
over
the
boxing
match
of
course
it
was
for
me
he
gave
it
i
knew
him
by
his
gaiters
and
the
walk
and
when
i
turned
round
a
minute
after
just
to
see
there
was
a
woman
after
coming
out
of
it
too
some
filthy
prostitute
then
he
goes
home
to
his
wife
after
that
only
i
suppose
the
half
of
those
sailors
are
rotten
again
with
disease
o
move
over
your
big
carcass
out
of
that
for
the
love
of
mike
listen
to
him
the
winds
that
waft
my
sighs
to
thee
so
well
he
may
sleep
and
sigh
the
great
suggester
don
poldo
de
la
flora
if
he
knew
how
he
came
out
on
the
cards
this
morning
hed
have
something
to
sigh
for
a
dark
man
in
some
perplexity
between
too
in
prison
for
lord
knows
what
he
does
that
i
dont
know
and
im
to
be
slooching
around
down
in
the
kitchen
to
get
his
lordship
his
breakfast
while
hes
rolled
up
like
a
mummy
will
i
indeed
did
you
ever
see
me
running
id
just
like
to
see
myself
at
it
show
them
attention
and
they
treat
you
like
dirt
i
dont
care
what
anybody
says
itd
be
much
better
for
the
world
to
be
governed
by
the
women
in
it
you
wouldnt
see
women
going
and
killing
one
another
and
slaughtering
when
do
you
ever
see
women
rolling
around
drunk
like
they
do
or
gambling
every
penny
they
have
and
losing
it
on
horses
yes
because
a
woman
whatever
she
does
she
knows
where
to
stop
sure
they
wouldnt
be
in
the
world
at
all
only
for
us
they
dont
know
what
it
is
to
be
a
woman
and
a
mother
how
could
they
where
would
they
all
of
them
be
if
they
hadnt
all
a
mother
to
look
after
them
what
i
never
had
thats
why
i
suppose
hes
running
wild
now
out
at
night
away
from
his
books
and
studies
and
not
living
at
home
on
account
of
the
usual
rowy
house
i
suppose
well
its
a
poor
case
that
those
that
have
a
fine
son
like
that
theyre
not
satisfied
and
i
none
was
he
not
able
to
make
one
it
wasnt
my
fault
we
came
together
when
i
was
watching
the
two
dogs
up
in
her
behind
in
the
middle
of
the
naked
street
that
disheartened
me
altogether
i
suppose
i
oughtnt
to
have
buried
him
in
that
little
woolly
jacket
i
knitted
crying
as
i
was
but
give
it
to
some
poor
child
but
i
knew
well
id
never
have
another
our
death
too
it
was
we
were
never
the
same
since
o
im
not
going
to
think
myself
into
the
glooms
about
that
any
more
i
wonder
why
he
wouldnt
stay
the
night
i
felt
all
the
time
it
was
somebody
strange
he
brought
in
instead
of
roving
around
the
city
meeting
god
knows
who
nightwalkers
and
pickpockets
his
poor
mother
wouldnt
like
that
if
she
was
alive
ruining
himself
for
life
perhaps
still
its
a
lovely
hour
so
silent
i
used
to
love
coming
home
after
dances
the
air
of
the
night
they
have
friends
they
can
talk
to
weve
none
either
he
wants
what
he
wont
get
or
its
some
woman
ready
to
stick
her
knife
in
you
i
hate
that
in
women
no
wonder
they
treat
us
the
way
they
do
we
are
a
dreadful
lot
of
bitches
i
suppose
its
all
the
troubles
we
have
makes
us
so
snappy
im
not
like
that
he
could
easy
have
slept
in
there
on
the
sofa
in
the
other
room
i
suppose
he
was
as
shy
as
a
boy
he
being
so
young
hardly
of
me
in
the
next
room
hed
have
heard
me
on
the
chamber
arrah
what
harm
dedalus
i
wonder
its
like
those
names
in
gibraltar
delapaz
delagracia
they
had
the
devils
queer
names
there
father
vilaplana
of
santa
maria
that
gave
me
the
rosary
rosales
y
oreilly
in
the
calle
las
siete
revueltas
and
pisimbo
and
mrs
opisso
in
governor
street
o
what
a
name
id
go
and
drown
myself
in
the
first
river
if
i
had
a
name
like
her
o
my
and
all
the
bits
of
streets
paradise
ramp
and
bedlam
ramp
and
rodgers
ramp
and
crutchetts
ramp
and
the
devils
gap
steps
well
small
blame
to
me
if
i
am
a
harumscarum
i
know
i
am
a
bit
i
declare
to
god
i
dont
feel
a
day
older
than
then
i
wonder
could
i
get
my
tongue
round
any
of
the
spanish
como
esta
usted
muy
bien
gracias
y
usted
see
i
havent
forgotten
it
all
i
thought
i
had
only
for
the
grammar
a
noun
is
the
name
of
any
person
place
or
thing
pity
i
never
tried
to
read
that
novel
cantankerous
mrs
rubio
lent
me
by
valera
with
the
questions
in
it
all
upside
down
the
two
ways
i
always
knew
wed
go
away
in
the
end
i
can
tell
him
the
spanish
and
he
tell
me
the
italian
then
hell
see
im
not
so
ignorant
what
a
pity
he
didnt
stay
im
sure
the
poor
fellow
was
dead
tired
and
wanted
a
good
sleep
badly
i
could
have
brought
him
in
his
breakfast
in
bed
with
a
bit
of
toast
so
long
as
i
didnt
do
it
on
the
knife
for
bad
luck
or
if
the
woman
was
going
her
rounds
with
the
watercress
and
something
nice
and
tasty
there
are
a
few
olives
in
the
kitchen
he
might
like
i
never
could
bear
the
look
of
them
in
abrines
i
could
do
the
criada
the
room
looks
all
right
since
i
changed
it
the
other
way
you
see
something
was
telling
me
all
the
time
id
have
to
introduce
myself
not
knowing
me
from
adam
very
funny
wouldnt
it
im
his
wife
or
pretend
we
were
in
spain
with
him
half
awake
without
a
gods
notion
where
he
is
dos
huevos
estrellados
senor
lord
the
cracked
things
come
into
my
head
sometimes
itd
be
great
fun
supposing
he
stayed
with
us
why
not
theres
the
room
upstairs
empty
and
millys
bed
in
the
back
room
he
could
do
his
writing
and
studies
at
the
table
in
there
for
all
the
scribbling
he
does
at
it
and
if
he
wants
to
read
in
bed
in
the
morning
like
me
as
hes
making
the
breakfast
for
he
can
make
it
for
im
sure
im
not
going
to
take
in
lodgers
off
the
street
for
him
if
he
takes
a
gesabo
of
a
house
like
this
id
love
to
have
a
long
talk
with
an
intelligent
welleducated
person
id
have
to
get
a
nice
pair
of
red
slippers
like
those
turks
with
the
fez
used
to
sell
or
yellow
and
a
nice
semitransparent
morning
gown
that
i
badly
want
or
a
peachblossom
dressing
jacket
like
the
one
long
ago
in
walpoles
only
or
ill
just
give
him
one
more
chance
ill
get
up
early
in
the
morning
im
sick
of
cohens
old
bed
in
any
case
i
might
go
over
to
the
markets
to
see
all
the
vegetables
and
cabbages
and
tomatoes
and
carrots
and
all
kinds
of
splendid
fruits
all
coming
in
lovely
and
fresh
who
knows
whod
be
the
man
id
meet
theyre
out
looking
for
it
in
the
morning
mamy
dillon
used
to
say
they
are
and
the
night
too
that
was
her
massgoing
id
love
a
big
juicy
pear
now
to
melt
in
your
mouth
like
when
i
used
to
be
in
the
longing
way
then
ill
throw
him
up
his
eggs
and
tea
in
the
moustachecup
she
gave
him
to
make
his
mouth
bigger
i
suppose
hed
like
my
nice
cream
too
i
know
what
ill
do
ill
go
about
rather
gay
not
too
much
singing
a
bit
now
and
then
mi
fa
pietà
masetto
then
ill
start
dressing
myself
to
go
out
presto
non
son
più
forte
ill
put
on
my
best
shift
and
drawers
let
him
have
a
good
eyeful
out
of
that
to
make
his
micky
stand
for
him
ill
let
him
know
if
thats
what
he
wanted
that
his
wife
is
fucked
yes
and
damn
well
fucked
too
up
to
my
neck
nearly
not
by
him
or
times
handrunning
theres
the
mark
of
his
spunk
on
the
clean
sheet
i
wouldnt
bother
to
even
iron
it
out
that
ought
to
satisfy
him
if
you
dont
believe
me
feel
my
belly
unless
i
made
him
stand
there
and
put
him
into
me
ive
a
mind
to
tell
him
every
scrap
and
make
him
do
it
out
in
front
of
me
serve
him
right
its
all
his
own
fault
if
i
am
an
adulteress
as
the
thing
in
the
gallery
said
o
much
about
it
if
thats
all
the
harm
ever
we
did
in
this
vale
of
tears
god
knows
its
not
much
doesnt
everybody
only
they
hide
it
i
suppose
thats
what
a
woman
is
supposed
to
be
there
for
or
he
wouldnt
have
made
us
the
way
he
did
so
attractive
to
men
then
if
he
wants
to
kiss
my
bottom
ill
drag
open
my
drawers
and
bulge
it
right
out
in
his
face
as
large
as
life
he
can
stick
his
tongue
miles
up
my
hole
as
hes
there
my
brown
part
then
ill
tell
him
i
want
or
perhaps
ill
tell
him
i
want
to
buy
underclothes
then
if
he
gives
me
that
well
he
wont
be
too
bad
i
dont
want
to
soak
it
all
out
of
him
like
other
women
do
i
could
often
have
written
out
a
fine
cheque
for
myself
and
write
his
name
on
it
for
a
couple
of
pounds
a
few
times
he
forgot
to
lock
it
up
besides
he
wont
spend
it
ill
let
him
do
it
off
on
me
behind
provided
he
doesnt
smear
all
my
good
drawers
o
i
suppose
that
cant
be
helped
ill
do
the
indifferent
or
questions
ill
know
by
the
answers
when
hes
like
that
he
cant
keep
a
thing
back
i
know
every
turn
in
him
ill
tighten
my
bottom
well
and
let
out
a
few
smutty
words
smellrump
or
lick
my
shit
or
the
first
mad
thing
comes
into
my
head
then
ill
suggest
about
yes
o
wait
now
sonny
my
turn
is
coming
ill
be
quite
gay
and
friendly
over
it
o
but
i
was
forgetting
this
bloody
pest
of
a
thing
pfooh
you
wouldnt
know
which
to
laugh
or
cry
were
such
a
mixture
of
plum
and
apple
no
ill
have
to
wear
the
old
things
so
much
the
better
itll
be
more
pointed
hell
never
know
whether
he
did
it
or
not
there
thats
good
enough
for
you
any
old
thing
at
all
then
ill
wipe
him
off
me
just
like
a
business
his
omission
then
ill
go
out
ill
have
him
eying
up
at
the
ceiling
where
is
she
gone
now
make
him
want
me
thats
the
only
way
a
quarter
after
what
an
unearthly
hour

getting
up
in
china
now
combing
out
their
pigtails
for
the
day
well
soon
have
the
nuns
ringing
the
angelus

nobody

odd
priest

his
night
office

the
alarmclock
next
door
at
cockshout
clattering
the
brains
out
of
itself
let
me
see
if
i
can
doze
off
what
kind
of
flowers

those
they
invented
like
the
stars
the
wallpaper
in
lombard
street

much
nicer
the
apron
he
gave
me

like
that
something

lamp

unlucky
day

can
accompany
him
first
i
must
clean
the
keys
of
the
piano
with
milk
whatll
i

i
wear
a
white
rose
or
those
fairy
cakes
in
liptons
i
love
the
smell
of
a
rich
big
shop
at
a
lb
or
the
other
ones
with
the
cherries
in
them
and
the
pinky
sugar

love
to
have
the
whole
place
swimming
in
roses
god
of
heaven
theres
nothing
like
nature
the
wild
mountains
then
the
sea
and
the
waves
rushing
then
the
beautiful
country
with
the
fields
of
oats
and
wheat
and
all
kinds
of
things
and
all
the
fine
cattle
going
about
that
would
do
your
heart
good
to
see
rivers
and
lakes
and
flowers
all
sorts
of
shapes
and
smells
and
colours
springing
up
even
out
of
the
ditches
primroses
and
violets
nature
it
is
as
for
them
saying
theres
no
god
i
wouldnt
give
a
snap
of
my
two
fingers
for
all
their
learning
why
dont
they
go
and
create
something
i
often
asked
him
atheists
or
whatever
they
call
themselves
go
and
wash
the
cobbles
off
themselves
first
then
they
go
howling
for
the
priest
and
they
dying
and
why
why
because
theyre
afraid
of
hell
on
account
of
their
bad
conscience
ah
yes
i
know
them
well
who
was
the
first
person
in
the
universe
before
there
was
anybody
that
made
it
all
who
ah
that
they
dont
know
neither
do
i
so
there
you
are
they
might
as
well
try
to
stop
the
sun
from
rising
tomorrow
the
sun
shines
for
you
he
said
the
day
we
were
lying
among
the
rhododendrons
on
howth
head
in
the
grey
tweed
suit
and
his
straw
hat
the
day
i
got
him
to
propose
to
me
yes
first
i
gave
him
the
bit
of
seedcake
out
of
my
mouth
and
it
was
leapyear
like
now
yes
years
ago
my
god
after
that
long
kiss
i
near
lost
my
breath
yes
he
said
i
was
a
flower
of
the
mountain
yes
so
we
are
flowers
all
a
womans
body
yes
that
was
one
true
thing
he
said
in
his
life
and
the
sun
shines
for
you
today
yes
that
was
why
i
liked
him
because
i
saw
he
understood
or
felt
what
a
woman
is
and
i
knew
i
could
always
get
round
him
and
i
gave
him
all
the
pleasure
i
could
leading
him
on
till
he
asked
me
to
say
yes
and
i
wouldnt
answer
first
only
looked
out
over
the
sea
and
the
sky
i
was
thinking
of
so
many
things
he
didnt
know
of
mulvey
and
mr
stanhope
and
hester
and
father
and
old
captain
groves
and
the
sailors
playing
all
birds
fly
and
i
say
stoop
and
washing
up
dishes
they
called
it
on
the
pier
and
the
sentry
in
front
of
the
governors
house
with
the
thing
round
his
white
helmet
poor
devil
half
roasted
and
the
spanish
girls
laughing
in
their
shawls
and
their
tall
combs
and
the
auctions
in
the
morning
the
greeks
and
the
jews
and
the
arabs
and
the
devil
knows
who
else
from
all
the
ends
of
europe
and
duke
street
and
the
fowl
market
all
clucking
outside
larby
sharons
and
the
poor
donkeys
slipping
half
asleep
and
the
vague
fellows
in
the
cloaks
asleep
in
the
shade
on
the
steps
and
the
big
wheels
of
the
carts
of
the
bulls
and
the
old
castle
thousands
of
years
old
yes
and
those
handsome
moors
all
in
white
and
turbans
like
kings
asking
you
to
sit
down
in
their
little
bit
of
a
shop
and
ronda
with
the
old
windows
of
the
posadas
glancing
eyes
a
lattice
hid
for
her
lover
to
kiss
the
iron
and
the
wineshops
half
open
at
night
and
the
castanets
and
the
night
we
missed
the
boat
at
algeciras
the
watchman
going
about
serene
with
his
lamp
and
o
that
awful
deepdown
torrent
o
and
the
sea
the
sea
crimson
sometimes
like
fire
and
the
glorious
sunsets
and
the
figtrees
in
the
alameda
gardens
yes
and
all
the
queer
little
streets
and
the
pink
and
blue
and
yellow
houses
and
the
rosegardens
and
the
jessamine
and
geraniums
and
cactuses
and
gibraltar
as
a
girl
where
i
was
a
flower
of
the
mountain
yes
when
i
put
the
rose
in
my
hair
like
the
andalusian
girls
used
or
shall
i
wear
a
red
yes
and
how
he
kissed
me
under
the
moorish
wall
and
i
thought
well
as
well
him
as
another
and
then
i
asked
him
with
my
eyes
to
ask
again
yes
and
then
he
asked
me
would
i
yes
to
say
yes
my
mountain
flower
and
first
i
put
my
arms
around
him
yes
and
drew
him
down
to
me
so
he
could
feel
my
breasts
all
perfume
yes
and
his
heart
was
going
like
mad
and
yes
i
said
yes
i
will
yes
